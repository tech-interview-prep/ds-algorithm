public class _249GroupShiftedStrings {
    /*
      Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd".
      We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:

      "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
      Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same
      shifting sequence.

      For example, given: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
      A solution is:

      [
        ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
        ["az","ba"],
        ["acef"],
        ["a","z"]
      ]
