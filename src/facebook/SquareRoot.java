/* 	
	Babylonian method for square root
	
	Algorithm:
	This method can be derived from (but predates) Newtonâ€“Raphson method.
	
	
	1 Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the 
	   root, the better).
	2 Initialize y = 1.
	3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
	  a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
	  b) Set y = n/x
