/*
    Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop
    DEFINITION
     Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer
     points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list

    EXAMPLE
     input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
     output: C
