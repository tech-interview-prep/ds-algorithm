in the phone interview: - pretty basic python algorithm question. Having read the others here, I assumed I&#039;d get pitched a softball and then a harder question. I was able to solve it within the first several minutes, but spent the rest of the session trying to optimize the solution. - some basic SQL questions on joins and such. I answered probably 5 or 6 questions. Both of these interviews seemed like minimum bar screens. For the in-person interview: - more difficult python question and had to code on a white board. It was a pretty simple sorting question that was easy to solve but less trivial to optimize. - more difficult SQL questions. I struggled here but I was a bit weaker in SQL so I figured as much. This progressed into dashboard design. - Lunch was at a cafe on campus and delicious. Interviewer was just asking me about work experience and culture and it seemed just like a general personality compatibility test. - Full Stack interview was my favorite part and a lot of fun. Without giving too much away, I was given a realistic problem and tasked with conceptualizing the solution in real time, from start to finish, on a white board. It was a mix of coding and conceptual and seemed to be meant to test product sense.   1 Answer

Data challenge was very similar to the ads analysis challenge on the book the collection of data science takehome challenge, so that was easy (if you have done your homework). SQL was: you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count. It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has listened to a given song. So count is cumulative sum. You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records in real time when a user listens to a given song. Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first table that has the lifetime count. If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there and then add the count of the last day.

Consider a game with 2 players, A and B. Player A has 8 stones, player B has 6. Game proceeds as follows. First, A rolls a fair 6-sided die, and the number on the die determines how many stones A takes over from B. Next, B rolls the same die, and the exact same thing happens in reverse. This concludes the round. Whoever has more stones at the end of the round wins and the game is over. If players end up with equal # of stones at the end of the round, it is a tie and another round ensues. What is the probability that B wins in 1, 2, ..., n rounds?   14 Answers

I was surprised that there were no machine learning or data mining questions, or any personality/experience ("tell me about a time when you...") questions. The more technical questions were things that a graduating CS student would succeed at, but did not involve principles that you would actually use in practice in a data role at a company. Also, make sure you continue working on a problem until you've provided the most efficient solution you think you can. I stopped after I had a working solution, and indicated to the interviewer that I don't think it's the most efficient solution. The interviewer said it was fine and we moved on to another question. Nonetheless, the biggest piece of feedback I got from the recruiter afterwards is that I didn't provide a solution that was sufficiently efficient.   Answer Question

Remove consecutive spaces with best complexity; For example, for the string &#034;---ABC--ef--fh--&#034; (I used &#034;-&#034; to replaces spaces, for better visibility), your answer should be &#034;-ABC-ef-fg-&#034;   1 Answer

You have a string that consists of all types of characters, alphanumeric, special, uppercase and lowercase. The string should still tell me that it is a palindrome or not. For example: 12@#.Race@#car. The example is a palindrome. (Omit the special characters, and do not consider the string to be case sensitive). I wrote the code in O(n), but I was using an extra string to store only the letters. The interviewer asked me to do it in place (use only that string and check for palindrome)   Answer Question

I can't discuss specifics due to NDA, but interview questions were neither overly difficult nor tricky. Check careercup and brush up on algorithms (string processing, binary trees, graphs, etc.). Practice coding fast (which potentially means forgetting good software engineering practices such as class design, refactoring as it will only slow you down).

Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview. That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:"123\n45\n6789"). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \n. Example: recv(): "123\n45\n6789"                ReadLine(): "123" //first call of ReadLine                ReadLine(): "45" // second call of ReadLine However, the next sequence now doesn't have a \n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \n. Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine                                                   recv():"abc"// still no \n...so you must call recv() again                                                   recv():"de\n" The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things). I've explained the problem as clearly as I can. Unfortunately, the interviewer kept overwriting his examples, and (I have to emphasize this) his accent made it really hard to understand just what he wanted out of this program.   1 Answer

I expected a tirade of technical questions. The unexpected part was that the interview was both ways: they interviewed me, I interviewed them. Most parts were more like brainstorming session than exams. The most difficult question was when a guy showed me a gdb stack trace of the threads within a process which hung. It was an facebook internal application, so I had no previous knowledge of that application. The question was what went wrong. Luckily, it was a clear situation where all threads were waiting for a blocked thread.   Answer Question

My failure to perform well on that question set a negative tone for the rest of the interview, since each interviewer after the first can see notes from the previous interviewers.   9 Answers

You are given an integer N and an integer M. You are supposed to write a method void findBestCoinsThatMinimizeAverage(int N, int M) that prints the best collection of N coins that minimize the average number of minimum coins needed to generate values from 1 to M. So, if M = 100, and N = 4, then if we use the set {1, 5, 10, 25} to generate each value from 1 to 100, so that for each value the number of coins are minimized, i.e. 1 = 1 (1 coin), 2 = 1 + 1 (2 coins),..., 6 = 1 + 5 (2 coins), ..., 24 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (8 coins), and we take the average of these coins, we would see that the average comes out to ~5.7. But if we instead use {1, 5, 18, 25}, the average would come out to be 3.7. We are to find that set of N coins, and print them, that produce the minimum average.   8 Answers

No very difficult questions. Just take it easy and enjoy the process. Almost all of the question are from the &lt;Cracking the Coding Interview&gt;. A quick response and emphasize on the issue of efficiency are important. I think Facebook love to ask questions about the tree structure and some practical questions because they are realistic problems. When you prepare and practice, do remember that efficiency is a really significant issue, much more important than simply giving an answer. And I would like recommend another book &lt;Programming pearls&gt;. Maybe the book is not a hard one to read, but the thought of the author, why the author wants to improve some algorithm and how he solves problems are really fantastic. The questions are from realistic problems and the book is really worth reading several times. It benefits me a lot.   Answer Question

You have a single branch of a GIT or SVN repository. At some commit number G, the code in the repo worked (G = good commit). At a later commit number B, you noticed that the code was broken (B = bad). The code may have become broken anytime at or before B, but after G. B was just the first time that you noticed the code was broken. Both G and B are positive integers and G < B. You have access to a function.......bool isCommitGood(integer)......... that takes a commit number and tells you whether the code at that commit worked or was broken. Write code to find the most recent working commit (i.e., the number/index of the last good commit before the code became broken).   1 Answer You have an unsorted array of integers and a function........string getCategory(integer)........which deterministically returns 1 of three possible strings: "low", "medium", or "high", depending on the input integer. You need to output an array with all the "low" numbers at the bottom, all the "medium" numbers in the middle, and all the "high" numbers at the top. This is basically a partial sort. Within each category, the order of the numbers does not matter...For example, you might be give the array [5,7,2,9,1,14,12,10,5,3]. For input integers 1 - 3, getCategory(integer) returns "low", for 4 - 10 it returns "medium," and for 11 - 15 it returns "high". You could output an array (or modify the given array) that looks like this: [3,1,2,5,5,9,7,10,14,12]   1 Answer

No very difficult questions. Just take it easy and enjoy the process. Almost all of the question are from the &lt;Cracking the Coding Interview&gt;. A quick response and emphasize on the issue of efficiency are important. I think Facebook love to ask questions about the tree structure and some practical questions because they are realistic problems. When you prepare and practice, do remember that efficiency is a really significant issue, much more important than simply giving an answer. And I would like recommend another book &lt;Programming pearls&gt;. Maybe the book is not a hard one to read, but the thought of the author, why the author wants to improve some algorithm and how he solves problems are really fantastic. The questions are from realistic problems and the book is really worth reading several times. It benefits me a lot.   Answer Question
