    Follow up for "Unique Paths":

    Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

    An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

    For example,
    There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

    [
      [0,0,0],
      [0,1,0],
      [0,0,0]

    The total number of unique paths is 2.

    Note: m and n will be at most 100.
