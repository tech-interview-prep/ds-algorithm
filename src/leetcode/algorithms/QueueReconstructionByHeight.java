/**
 * Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k),
 * where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater
 * than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The number of people is less than 1,100.
 * <p>
 * Example
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
