/**
 * Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.
 * <p>
 * Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those
 * horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * Given words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =
 * <p>
 * [
 * ['o','a','a','n'],
 * ['e','t','a','e'],
 * ['i','h','k','r'],
 * ['i','f','l','v']
 * ]
 * Return ["eat","oath"].
 * Note:
 * You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
 * <p>
 * You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?
 * <p>
 * If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. What kind of
 * data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you
 * would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, please work on this problem: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) first.
 * <p>
