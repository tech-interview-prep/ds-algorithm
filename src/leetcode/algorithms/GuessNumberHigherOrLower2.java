/**
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * <p>
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * <p>
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 * <p>
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the
 * number I picked.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * n = 10, I pick 8.
 * <p>
 * First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 * Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 * Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 * <p>
 * Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 * <p>
 * You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
 * <p>
 * Hint:
 * <p>
 * The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face. Another strategy is to
 * minimize the expected loss. Here, we are interested in the first scenario.
 * <p>
 * Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
 * <p>
 * Check out this article if you're still stuck.
 * <p>
 * The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n. You MUST use dynamic
 * programming.
 * <p>
 * As a follow-up, how would you modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss, instead of the
 * worst-case loss?
 * <p>

     * DP, top-down.
     * Minimize the maximum of each possible move.
     * The maximum here means the move will always lead to the worst branch.
     * For each move, you can pick randomly from 1 to n, as i.
     * You pay i dollars, and then pick another time from the rest of the two ranges:
     * 1) From 1 to i - 1 2) From i + 1 to end .
     * Recurrence relation:
     * The most money to pay for this move = The money you pay for the current move + The maximum of the most money you
     * pay for left part and right part.
     * The minimum of the maximums is the answer.
