/**
 * Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 <= i <= num calculate the number of 1's in
 * their binary representation and return them as an array.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * <p>
 * It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n)
 * /possibly in a single pass?
 * Space complexity should be O(n).
 * Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other
 * language.
 * Hint:
 * <p>
 * You should make use of what you have produced already.
 * Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.
 * Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?
 * <p>

     * Recurrence Relation: f[i] = f[i / 2] + i % 2.
     * It means that we can decompose the binary string of current integer into two parts:
     * 1) the rightmost bit
     * 2) from the second rightmost bit to the leftmost bit
     * For example: if i = 5, the binary string is 101, "10" + "1"
     * So the number of bits relates to the # of bits of i / 2, and whether it's odd or even.
     * If it's even, it has the same number of bits as "10", which is 1.
     * If it's odd, it has one more, which is 2.
