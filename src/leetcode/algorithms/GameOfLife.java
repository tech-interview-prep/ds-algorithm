/**
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised
 * by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 * <p>
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its
 * eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
 * article):
 * <p>
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some
 * cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 * In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause
 * problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
 * <p>
