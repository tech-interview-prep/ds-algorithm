/**
 * Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10^n.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 <= x < 100, excluding
 * [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])
 * <p>
 * Hint:
 * <p>
 * A direct way is to use the backtracking approach.
 * Backtracking should contains three states which are (the current number, number of steps to get that number and a
 * bitmask which represent which number is marked as visited so far in the current number). Start with state (0,0,0) and
 * count all valid number till we reach number of steps equals to 10n.
 * This problem can also be solved using a dynamic programming approach and some knowledge of combinatorics.
 * Let f(k) = count of numbers with unique digits with length equals k.
 * f(1) = 10, ..., f(k) = 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (9 - k + 2) [The first factor is 9 because a number cannot start with 0].
 * <p>
