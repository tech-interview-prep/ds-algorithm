    /*
      Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be
      stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
      same or another computer environment.

      Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
      serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be
      serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

      For example, you may serialize the following tree

          1
         / \
        2   3
           / \
          4   5
      as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily
      need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

      Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms
      should be stateless.
