/**
 * Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those
 * integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
 * <p>
 * For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).
 * <p>
 * Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
 * <p>
 * Hint:
 * <p>
 * There is a simple O(n) solution to this problem.
 * You may check the breaking results of n ranging from 7 to 10 to discover the regularities.
