 * The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

 * By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The read function may be called multiple times.

     * What is the difference between call once and call multiple times?
     * When you call read4() which reads 4 bytes into your buffer you might read more than you need.
     * So you want to store those bytes.
     * And next time you call read will start from those stored bytes, then read more from the file.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * You have 4 chars "a, b, c, d" in the file, and you want to call your function twice like this:
     * read(buf, 1); // should return 'a'
     * read(buf, 3); // should return 'b, c, d'
     * All the 4 chars will be consumed in the first call of read4().
     * So the tricky part of this question is:
     * how can you preserve the remaining 'b, c, d' to the second call.
