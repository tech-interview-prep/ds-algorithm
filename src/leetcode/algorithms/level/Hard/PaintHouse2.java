/**
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with
 * a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * <p>
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0]
 * is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on...
 * <p>
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers.
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

    /**
     * DP.
     * Recurrence relation:
     * min(n) = min(n-1) + min(cost[n-1][i], 0 <= i < k, i != j, where j is cost[n-2][j])
     * OR min(n) = secMin(n-1) + min(cost[n-1][i], 0 <= i < k, i == j, where j is cost[n-2][j])
     * Safely use previous minimum if colors are different.
     * If colors are the same, use second minimum of previous result.
     * So we need to keep track of minimum, second minimum and the index of last minimum.
     * <p>
     * Special case:
     * When k=1, there is only 1 color. If there is more than 1 house, invalid.
     * Loop through houses from 0 to n-1.
     * For each house, try to find minimum, second minimum, minimum index by looping through all colors.
     * For each color, get the minimum candidate value by add the cost with previous min or second min.
     * If minimum index is not set yet, update current minimum and current index.
     * If value < current min, update second min first, then update current min and index.
     * If value < current second min, update second min.
     * After min of this house is found, remember the current min, current second min and index for the next house.
