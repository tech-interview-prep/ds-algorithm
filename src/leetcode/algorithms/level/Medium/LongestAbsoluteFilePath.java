/**
 * Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:
 * <p>
 * The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:
 * <p>
 *  dir
 *      subdir1
 *      subdir2
 *          file.ext
 * The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.
 * <p>
 * The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:
 * <p>
 *  dir
 *      subdir1
 *      file1.ext
 *          subsubdir1
 *      subdir2
 *          subsubdir2
 *              file2.ext
 * The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty
 * second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file
 * file2.ext.
 * <p>
 * We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For
 * example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length
 * is 32 (not including the double quotes).
 * <p>
 * Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to
 * file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The name of a file contains at least a . and an extension.
 * The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a ..
 * Time complexity required: O(n) where n is the size of the input string.
 * <p>
 * Notice that a/aa/aaa/file1.txt is not the longest file path, if there is another path aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png.
