/**
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * <p>
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is
 * expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * <p>
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take
 * to finish all courses.
 * <p>
 * There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all
 * courses, return an empty array.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * 2, [[1,0]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course
 * order is [0,1]
 * <p>
 * 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
 * There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses
 * 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct
 * ordering is[0,2,1,3].
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a
 * graph is represented.
 * <p>
 * Hints:
 * 1. This problem is equivalent to finding the topological order in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no
 * topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
 * 2. Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of
 * Topological Sort.
 * 3. Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
