/**
 * The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the
 * bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid
 * out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the
 * top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the
 * princess.
 *
 * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If
 * at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
 *
 * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health
 * (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty
 * (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive
 * integers).
 *
 * In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to
 * move only rightward or downward in each step.
 *
 * Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he
 * is able to rescue the princess.
 *
 * For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must
 * be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
 *
 * -2(K)    -3      3
 * -5       -10     1
 * 10       30      -5(P)
 *
 * Notes:
 * The knight's health has no upper bound.
 * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight
 * enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

    /**
     * Why “from the bottom right corner to left top”?
     * It depends on the way you formulate the problem. If you define a value
     * in DP table d[i][j] as 'the minimum hp required to REACH (i, j) from (0,
     * 0)", then the final answer should be d[nrows-1][ncols-1], and you need
     * to start filling from the top left;
     * However, in the reference answer provided with the question, dp[i][j] is
     * defined as 'the minimum hp required to REACH (nrows-1, ncols-1) from (i,
     * j)'. Here dp[0][0] is the final answer so we must fill from (nrows-1,
     * ncols-1). For many other problems such as 'Minimum Path Sum', both
     * formulation would work.
     * However, in this problem, the former formulation will lead us to
     * trouble, because it is very hard, if not impossible, to get d[i][j]
     * based on d[i-1][j] and d[i][j-1].
