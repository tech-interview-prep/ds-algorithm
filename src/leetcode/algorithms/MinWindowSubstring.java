 * Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in

 * For example,
 * S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
 * T = "ABC"
 * Minimum window is "BANC".

 * Note:
 * If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".

 * If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in

     * 3. When a valid window is found, move start to find a smaller window.

     * One for T and the other for the window in S.
     * Use two pointers to traverse S, the String in between is the window.
     * The pointer in the front moves when the window doesn't cover all characters in T.
     * The pointer in the back moves when the window covers all characters, to get as smaller window as possible.
     * Stop when the front pointer reaches the end.
     * We need a variable to remember the minimum window length during this procedure.
     * How to know whether T is covered by the window with two maps? Comparing them would be costly.
     * Use a variable called letterCnt to keep track of the letters covered.
     * When the character is in T, and the count in window is less than or equal to the count in T, increase letterCnt.
     * When letterCnt >= length of T, we know that T is fully covered.
