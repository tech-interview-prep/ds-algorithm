Here are nine psychological tricks you can use at the job interview to increase your chances of getting the job:

Likability and the Similarity Principle

Many hiring managers and interviewers hire those that they like. Here are some ways to increase your likability:

Use the same language. If you sound like them, you must be like them. Copy similar vocabulary and patterns of speech. Also copy their speech pace.
Use the same gestures. (Same as above.)
Dress the same way. If you look like them, you must be like them.
Have the same hobbies. If they like foosball and yoga, build attraction by claiming similar interests.
Have the same affiliation. There's a reason why millions pay to go to Harvard or join the local country club.
Emphasize similar experiences. Instead of saying, "You went to Princeton, and I went to Yale." Say "We're similar: we both graduated from Ivy League schools."
Passion Principle

Human beings get energized by those who are upbeat and optimistic. Be careful! Over do it, and you'll rub others the wrong way. Recommendation: gauge the interviewer's energy level, and exceed it by 10%.
Needs Principle

Every individual has a core set of psychological needs: validation and inclusion are the two big ones. For the first one, validate the other person. Acknowledge their accomplishments or feelings. Give them the appreciation that they only seem to get from their mother. For the second one, include the other person. It's a little tougher to pull off at the interview. However, let's say the interviewer is new to the city, you might be able to make them feel "included" by inviting them to a insider-only party.
Detail Principle

Interviewers find candidates that use detailed stories more credible and competent than those that do not. Warning: detail does not mean filling up airtime with jargon. Interviewers are smart enough to see past that.
