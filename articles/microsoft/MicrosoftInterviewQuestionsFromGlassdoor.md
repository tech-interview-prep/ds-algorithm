Although you can easily find these online, there's no need to memorize them since they aren't hard to go through and if you're vocal about your thought process, the interviewer may steer you in the right direction. The onsite interviews were a mix between technical (implement this) and theoretical (how would you...) questions. For the technical ones you can be well prepared by understanding Cracking the coding interview, while for the theoretical ones you mostly need a little bit of experience and imagination.   Answer Question

Given a directory string "c/a/../b/./d" write a method that outputs the final directory. (In this example, "c/b/d"). A "." input stays in the current directory, a ".." input goes back one.   1 Answer Design a method midNumbers(start, end, length) that prints the middle values between two integers. Ex: midNumbers(0,5,2) would print 2,3. midNumbers(1,10,4) would print 4,5,6,7. This question was left VERY vague and I think it was intentionally left up to the interviewee to clarify as much as possible. Follow ups included "How would you check for appropriate input? How would you protect against attacks, such as a buffer overflow attack? What are some cases that you would test to check that the method is working correctly?"   Answer Question How would you convert a row number on Excel to a label? Rows are labeled alphabetically with letters added on once the alphabet has been fully used. (Ex. row # 5 is labeled E, row # 27 is labeled AA, row # 28 is AB, row # 53 is BA and so forth) What would the row label be for a large number, such as 1500?   1 Answer

Questions included: - What's a hash function?   - How can it be used as part of a dictionary?   - If you're designing a hash function for a class that will be used as part of a dictionary lookup, what things should you consider? - Sketch an design for a tree-like data structure, and then an algorithm for depth-first search. - What are precision and recall? How are they defined? Why are they defined this way not some other way?

Since I signed an NDA, I will not really post any questions. But I can tell you that you need your data structures down pat (not red-black trees or anything that complex). While you can memorize all the questions and algorithms out there, understanding the high level aspects of them (backtracking, dynamic programming, simple string manipulation, etc.) pays off when you encounter a question you've never seen before. Third, you need to know what your team does to know what they can ask. If it's a system development role, you need to brush up on your OS fundamentals, networking etc. Finally, prepare for any behavioral questions you could be asked. There are a ton out there online and they pretty much cover all the ground. Linking these answers to specific projects on your resume is certain bonus points.   Answer Question

Along with representation write the add and delete function for this linked list. (Note: No pseudo code business there, had to write proper code).

Four technical questions: 1) Given an MxM array make it rotate in a certain way. The rotation was a little complicated and I couldn't answer this question very well. The interviewer did not do a very good job explaining it.   Answer Question 2) Write a new version of strcpy where it will return the null terminator no matter what. Did a better job on this one the guy said he was evaluating for correctness not only for idea.   Answer Question 3) Given a string with many words make a function that would reverse all of the letters in every word. For this one I first wrote a crappy algorithm that takes O(n^2) but then I did a better one that worked in linear time.   Answer Question 4) This guy was more complicated he first asked me different questions about object oriented programming. I did not know what a virtual class was. He then asked me to do some string manipulation and kept making the problem harder until we ran out of time. The problem he started off with was write an algorithm that counts how many repeated letters are in a string and kept going from there. -- There was very few behavioral questions about my favorite projects.   Answer Question

Assume no 0 or 1's are provided, as they do not have characters in it. A function bool isValid(string) is provided, so you may know whether a word is considered valid.   1 Answer Write a function which will receive an hour and minute from an analog clock, and calculate the inner angle between them.   1 Answer Write a for loop, which prints the odd numbers from 0 to N.   1 Answer Write a function that receives two pointers, and swaps the values between them.   1 Answer Implement a function that returns (or prints) a Fibonacci sequence. The function will receive two integers, an index (idx) and the number of results (N). The function should return the Fibonacci sequence starting from the idx and up to N results. Example: The Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... The sequence is supposed to be viewed as an array, so if index 6 was provided, calculations should start from number 8. Suppose index 3 is provided and 3 results must be returned. The result should be: 2, 3, 5.   Answer Question

During the face to face interview it was very informal but in the majority it was a technical interview, wasnt once asked anything like 'Tell me a bit about yourself'. The closest I came to this question was, tell me about your computer, which I was able to answer like a breeze because I finished building it 1 month prior. During the 1 hour interview, we barely sat down. In the room was myself, the team leader and what I believe to be a developer currently on the team. We were all in a small conference room and I was being asked questions and being asked to write small code samples on a whiteboard. The questions elaborated upon my technical evaluation form which I completed at the start of the process. Going through my pieces of code, how could I improve it etc. The interview also had some abstract questions, I believe these were to assess my thought processes.   Answer Question

I have no web experience (and don't claim to; I'm computer engineering and am more interested in low level programming and firmware, as indicated on my resume and the form I returned to schedule the interview). I admitted to my ignorance and was instead asked to redesign a parking structure near my university on a game day that had a traffic problem. I was given a couple minutes and a piece of paper. I basically did a nodal analysis on a circuit, with the streets being akin to wires and wrote a differential for cars entering the lot.

On campus interview questions: 1) Find the middle of a linked list 2) Find all the paths in a binary tree that sum up to a given value 3) Write test cases for bing (yeah, really!) On site interviews: - Interview 1: After discussing past projects. Write test cases for a routine that takes input 2 Cartesian coordinates and draws a line joining them, but the display pane can show points only such that x and y are between -100 and 100. How would you design it for a blind person. Choose the best 6 test cases and why. - Interview 2: After discussing my resume. Write code to find all the palindromes in a string. Code both naive and efficient approaches. What if the string had spaces also, like "race car", which is also a palindrome. What if characters similar to an alphabet, from other languages were also be considered as the same character. What if you were implementing a web service with a page that takes input string in a textbox and displays all the palindromes. What test cases would you write to see the service works fine. What of your service was being used only by people in Germany. How can you optimize? - Interview 3: After resume discussion, talks for 5 minutes about his team, MS Office Sharepoint. Just 1 question for the entire interview. Given an API with a string argument and an int return type, what could it be doing. Imagine the different possibilities and how would you decide the testcases, based on the functionality of the API you thought of. Think on test that assure sanity, +ve examples, -ve examples, security, scalability of the API. - Interview 4: Discusses my resume, talks about his team and shortly about his experience of 20 years at MSFT (at which I instantly remarked, I would have never been able to pull that off!). Says that I see from your feedback that you are more of a problem solver, so I would like to test your imagination. Asks me to implement string.Split(some char) API of C#. Write test cases that would fail my code. Write code to fix those failures, iterate till all are resolved. At the end, tries to sell me the SDET position, says it's lots of fun and SDE/SDET switching happens every couple of years. Otherwise, MSFT pampers it on-site invitees. They pick you up from the hotel and airport in a limo, $75/day just for meals, crazy discounts in the MSFT store, free taxi/rental car to explore the city and $50 reimbursable, apart from meals and taxis if you want to buy other stuff.   2 Answers

2nd round: "What is the data structure which suits best for the Battleship game? The board will be of size n x n, with m different ships each having k1, ..., km lengths. Each ship can either by place horizontally or vertically on the board. The structures should be designed such that they can support basic operations for playing a game. For example, the board and a particular (i, j) coordinate representing a position on the board may be passed into a function attack(). The function should return hit if a ship was hit at that position, sunk if a ship has sunk after being attacked at that position, and miss if no ship is at that position. Describe your design of the structures, what kind of data they store, and the runtime complexity of typical operations for playing the game (like the attack() function) as a result of your design decisions" I was coming with an O(n) solution during attack, which was my first attempt and then I was thinking about optimization.

Most of the technical questions, I felt very prepared for. The most difficult questions were behavioral. In particular, "Tell me about an experience where a project partner enjoyed working with you." Rather than talking about your skills you have to talk about how you worked well with others in a way that they enjoyed working with you, and do so without coming off as being arrogant. Also, they didn't ask the question directly, but came to it in a way that put you on the back foot. The question immediately before was to tell them about a time that you had difficulty working with a partner, and also about a time that a partner had difficulty working with you.   1 Answer

Someone codes and interface that consists of 3 input text boxes and a start button. When the start button is pressed a triangle will be drawn on the screen.

How would you test this program?   Answer Question You are in a room by yourself and someone walks into the room, asks you to find the temperature, and leaves. How would you find the temperature in the room without leaving the room?   3 Answers We have a quadtree algorithm and we are assuming that the boxes are labeled 0 (top left), 1 (top right), 2 (bottom left), 3 (bottom right) 'n' times. Write a function that when given an array input of n size (ie. [0,0,0,0] or [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] would be the top left corner) would determine if the corresponding box has at least one side touching at least one of the outermost walls.   Answer Question Write a function (in your preferred language C, C++, or Java) that will take the given string and return the reverse. (ie. input:"abc def ghi" output:"ihg fed cba") Optimize the above code (if possible). Now knowing that the original function you wrote in pt1 is being used by other programs and cannot be modified write another function that when called will utilize the function from pt1 to only reverse the words in the sentence. (ie. input:"abc def ghi" output:"ghi def abc") Test your code.   2 Answers Write a function that when given a string will return the position of the starting point of the largest reoccurring character.

For example if you have weights 1 and 3,now you can measure 1,3 and 4 like earlier case, and also you can measure 2,by placing 3 on one side and 1 on the side which contain the substance to be weighed. So question again is how many minimum weights and of what denominations you need to measure all weights from 1kg to 1000kg.   Answer Question

Imagine there are n cities (say c1, c2....cn) connected circularly and each of them has a petrol bunk (say p1,p2...pn). The distance between each cities are d1, d2...dn. Here 1unit of petrol will be used to travel 1unit of distance. You can start from any city so that you can go through all of them and reach the same location (city). Find from where we've to begin the navigation. FOR EXAMPLE: c1--&gt;c2--&gt;c3--&gt;c1 p1 has 2ltr p2 has 10ltr p3 has 4ltr and the distance between each cities: c1&lt;--&gt;c2: 3 c2&lt;--&gt;c3: 2 c3&lt;--&gt;c1: 8 Here we've to start at c2 in-order to come back again to the same place. Explain the logic to find whether u can come back to the same location. Find where to start. Write a program for the same. Write test cases for the same.   1 Answer You're converting a string (s1) into another (s2) by changing the characters in s1. You can do add/delete/replace the characters of s1 to get s2. The cost of any of those operation for a character is 1. Find the minimum cost to convert s1 into s2. Write program and test cases for the same. For example: Convert "Hi" into "Hey". This would require minimum two cost. 1. Replace 'i' with 'e' in s1 2. Add 'y' to s1. Now we've s2.   1 Answer Write a program to iterate through a 2D grid in a spiral way. Since I can't attach images here, I'll explain it using an array. Imagine you've a nxm matrix of bytes. you've iterate through it in a spiral way. It means, iterate the first row (left to right), then iterate through the right most column (top-bottom) then iterate the bottom most row (right-left) until you reach the center of the matrix. Hope its clear now.   1 Answer You've a singly linked list where every node in the list has a field "random" which points to other node in the same list. Write a function to clone this list (create a new copy of the same). Don't use extra space (just the pointer variables are fine).   3 Answers Some other standard questions: 1. Given a BST and a range, print all the numbers that comes in that range. Ex: the function will be something like: print(node * head, int x, int y); It has to print all numbers within the rage x&y 2. Print max height (level) of a binary search tree. 3. Given an array of integers, determine the sub array which makes max sum. 4. Find LCA of the binary search tree.   1 Answer

A rat starts from source and has to reach destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with limited number of moves.   Answer Question

There is a disk on a turn table. Half of it is black, and the other half is white. It is rotating in constant speed, but it's rotating fast so that you can't see whether it's going clockwise or counterclockwise. You also have a set of stationary sensors you can install anywhere which can tell whether the color of a spot has changed from black to white, or vice versa. What is the minimum number of sensors needed to find out which way the disk is rotating? What is the best, average, worst time to figure out the direction? If you use more sensors, can you improve the best, average, worst time? How can you accomplish that? If you are given only one sensor, how can you find out the direction, assuming you can change one constraint of the problem?   1 Answer

I was asked to write an algorithm in C++ to sort an array. The function I was to write was to take in a string of letters "b" and "r". b = a red ball and r = a blue ball. The function was to return an integer with the least number of swaps needed to separate the balls to be next to their own colors... So for example, RBBR would return 1, since you only need to swap one of the letters to be RRBB or BBRR.   Answer Question
