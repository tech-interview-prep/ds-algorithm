I had a phone interview with them after submitting my resume and also through employee referral. They asked me a lot of simple programming questions and even the "tricky" programming questions in which they try to assess how you think.

Microsoft had come to the campus for providing summer internships. First, there was an online coding round. The questions had MCQs and 2 coding challenges. It had to be completed in 1.5 hours. The coding question was to search for an element in a sorted, rotated array. The second question was to find the in order successor in a binary tree. Students who cleared the coding round got one-on-one interviews. There were 2 rounds of interviews : one technical and one behavioural. The entire process lasted for a day.

The interviewer asked me just one coding question: You are given a number as an integer. You have to print it in words: e.g. input : 1234 Output : One thousand two hundred thirty four. Followed by this, was a question on testing. He asked me what kind of tests can be performed to check the standard conditions on a microwave?   Answer Question

They also asked me a brain teaser (3,5,8 gallon water jug problem) and I did not complete it. The onsite was 4 45 minute interviews that were each about half behavioral and half white-boarding.

Applied through university a while ago, but it took an incredibly long time to get the final round interview which was very frustrating. Questions weren't hard, but finding the optimal solution was the bigger challenge. I also got asked a bit manipulation question that was difficult for me having never come across those problems before and having never use those functions before. The actual final round interview experience was enjoyable, but the lack of communication before that was very frustrating to deal with as I got notified of my final round with less time to prepare than I had ideally wanted.

Applied through a connection. Microsoft then came to my school and held interviews. My interviewer was very cold, apathetic, and unhappy. She blazed through the behavioral portion of the interview and didn't really care much for what I had to say. She also only allowed me to ask ONE question at the end of the interview, despite not being short on time. She didn't even greet me with a smile as interviewers tend to do. Personality aside, she asked me to "implement a queue with a stack interface," but she did not want me to use extra memory. I told her it wasn't possible, but she told me that a stack is just an array, and revealed that she wanted me to reverse the stack in place. This is a violation of the stack abstraction, so I was very unsure if she actually wanted me to do as she said. In the end I didn't get an offer. She was one of the most unpleasant human beings I've ever encountered. She also was very unclear with what she expected out of me. I don't know why they would send her from Seattle to the east coast to interview when she clearly did not enjoy human interaction.

Worst company to interview for. Recruiters don't respond to their emails and there's no coordination between them. You usually have to pass an HR phone interview before being invited for the final round of on-site interviews. I have passed 3 HR interviews (in consecutive years) but I've never got the chance to reach the final round because the recruiters simply didn't get back to me no matter how many times I have insisted. I also know friends who were supposed to fly to a Microsoft office for the final round but they never got the plane tickets. In Eastern Europe I understand that they interview a batch of candidates at the time, so you either make it in that batch or never hear from them again.

I had the initial phone screen and got rejected 3 weeks later. They asked me a series of behavioral questions, and one logic puzzle (fruits and baskets with wrong labels). I am surprised and disappointed in the rejection because I feel that I'm a strong candidate (had final round interviews with very competitive companies). I solved the brain teaser and felt I did a decent job on the behavioral aspect. However, my interviewer was NOT a technical person, so she couldn't answer any of the more technical oriented questions I asked at the end. I remember my interview only lasted about 20 minutes. She ended my interview before I could think of more questions to ask. I am very confident that if I had a technical person interview me, they'd have a way better understanding of my skill set. Needless to say I won't be applying to Microsoft again.

I was approached by email after attending a few career events and Microsoft competitions. The process before the interview was smooth, but the initial technical interview itself was pretty horrible. My interviewer was running 15 minutes late, which to him meant that my interview would have to be compressed down to 15 minutes. That meant no time for anything other than technical questions, i.e. nothing about my background or similar. I solved the technical question in an okay way quite quickly, even though it wasn't the optimal solution. He then probed for a slightly better solution, and I produced a different solution. This was still not the one he was looking for though, and I needed a hint to be able to figure out what that was. Note that all three of these solutions were linear, so it was the space complexity he was after.

After sending my CV via email, I got a response withing a few weeks to attend a written test. It consisted of 4-5 data structure and algorithm tasks and 2 from math. The difficulty of the tasks was average to hard. Afterwards I was invited to and interview. I was interviewed with 3 different interviewers who mainly asked some other data structure questions. It seemed that the tasks on the interview were easier than on the test, but during my answer they asked several related questions to describe time and space complexity and my solution to some edge cases. After interview I waited for around 2 months for response, but since I got an offer, it didn't matter.

First round was on campus. The interviewer was kind, and the problem was straightforward recursion programming problem.. I got noticed to have on-site interview on the next day after first round ended. The on-site interview had 4 rounds. Problems in first two rounds were not very hard. In the third round, I interviewed with a project manager but didn't do well. He asked me what was the most difficult problem I solved while preparing for this interview, and need me to explain the whole thing. I messed up since I forgot how to solve the problem I told him. The fourth round was a quite easy binary tree problem but my brain was not functioning well until interviewer gave me tips. Overall, I think the interview process was quite long and intense, though the coding problems were not hard. It's the PM that's hard to deal with.

I am posting and rating this interview experience as negative only because of one person(Sr SDE) that was involved in the process, I will get back to her behavior later. First thing first,Hiring manager and product manager were really nice persons, they were very professional. My first interview was with product manager, which went for 45 min and I was asked some ethical, behavioral and product related questions. My 2nd interview was a technical loop with Sr SDE, about which I will discuss later in a separate paragraph. My 3rd interview was with Hiring manager, which lasted beyond time limit of 60 min, I was asked some tough questions but we both were enjoying conversation and he seemed impressed with my talk and experience. After the interview I was told by hiring manager that he will take hiring decision by eod tom only as he will meet everyone today evening or tom morning. After the interview I had the gut feeling that I nailed it, as I aced all 3 interviews. Though I can't comment on how my answers to behavioral and ethical questions were taken, but for some questions,I was told on the spot by product manager that what I answered was a correct answer and this was to test core values. My only concern was technical interview even though I nailed every question asked, because of behavior and conduct of interviewer, now lets jump to what happened in technical round. I was introduced to Sr SDE( who was a tester for most of her career at MS, I think she was made SDE because of last year's changes in MS) by Product Manager. It was supposed to be a lunch interview for about 90 min, with lunch from 12:00 to 12:30 and from 12:30 to 1:30 continue interview in conference room. I greeted this lady but I was not given any response. She ignored the schedule and directly took me to conference room for interview. She didn't had copy of my Resume, I had 4/5 copies of my resume with me, so I shared one with her. She asked me a TSQL question on white board, which I resolved in like 5 sec, she then got surprised and tried to made it complicated, I resolved that too quickly, then she asked me what if each of these intervals are dynamic in nature, I resolved that too, she told me it will not work, I told her lets test to check and it worked. She accepted that it will work. Then she asked me ranking function related TSQL question, which again I resolved in 10 sec, she then asked me how you will test it. I told her about 7/8 test cases and how you can write all these in VS DB unit testing project. My resume has lot of other stuff like Big data, Machine learning, Python, Java and data science. It was very clear that she didn't had any experience with any of these as she completely ignored asking any question related to these. She then asked me how you will predict sales amount for our product, which is very open ended question, I talked about it for like 10 min(discussed different feature selection, model selection and validation tech and challenges around curse of dimensionality and how to take care of it) and it became clear that she didn't understood what I am talking and also she didn't asked me a single follow up question. Only question she asked me, how much out of these I have implemented. With her facial expression and postures I became sure that she didn't came prepared for interview and she also don't know much about ML/data science/Datawarehouse/Big Data/MPP and analytical technologies, for which she was supposed to interview me. She then asked me do you know .NET(not listed on my resume). I said no I don't , but then she replied, oh you know Java( I said yes as it was on my resume, expecting some follow up algorithm question or oop question), but she didn't asked me any question related to algorithm or OOP. She then ended interview asking if I have any questions. After the interview she took me to lunch area in Microsoft and though it was a lunch interview sponsored by MS, I PAID FROM MY POCKET FOR THE LUNCH as she pointed me to pay! After that she just wanted to leave me unattended(Though my MS issued ID said, I should be escorted all times for security reasons), I asked her can I sit in the conference room till start of my next interview, she replied yes and then she asked me to walk myself to hiring manager room after 15 min and she left me unescorted for next 15 min. I greeted her before she left, she didn't replied back and just left. Only idea I got at the end of this interview with her was that she didn't liked me at all from the very go. Later it took me 5 min to search for hiring manager room. Though I am none to comment on the competencies and professional behavior of any individual. But this is the last thing I was expecting from a Microsoft Senior Software Developer. I would definitely like Microsoft HR to look into this issue.

Interview started at my local university. I didn't initially consider them but a friend referred me and I applied. The interview was done in two parts - the first was a simple whiteboard question (some basic recursion / string processing question), the second was a personality quiz (why should you work for Microsoft, what products don't you like, how could you improve it, etc.) They rang back and told me I was considered for round 2, and they flow me to Sydney, Australia (pretty awesome in itself!) This was an all-day event split into 4 parts. The first was a simple C string processing question which I confidently answered, but the interviewer didn't show any signs if I was right or not. The second question was a low-level kernel question that I didn't know the answer to, but the interviewer helpfully explained it to me when I told him that I had designed my own kernel in assembly but didn't know this particular instruction. The third session I was taken out and sat aside (no question), but took this opportunity to show the recruiter some personal projects that I was working on (I think this is what got me in!). The fourth session I had a headache and completely bombed. They offered me a position on the spot, which I was thrilled about and accepted! I honestly believe having personal projects will put you above every other candidate (though technical skills are required too!)

A day later the technical guy who was the manager of the team wrote to me with details to set up the interview, it was over Skype. It was a 45 minutes long interview. The interviewer good, explained me about his team and started by asking me my interest moved to getting me solving a problem. I had to use Whiteboard tool to write my code, It was not a very tough problem. Good knowledge of data structure and one programming language would suffice. I wrote the code while explaining my solution in between. He suggested an optimization. Also, there was a bug in my solution, which returned the answer with some redundancy. I agree it was not a very good solution. By the end of call he told that he is looking for more experienced candidate with very strong skills in C++ (I chose C++ as my main language at start) so would not continue the process with me for next round and asked to apply for other positions at Microsoft.

I received an email for Technical Talent Sourcer requesting for a chat. We talked on the phone and after a few days I had a technical interview via Skype: a coding question + a problem solving question. For the next round I was invited for an on-site interview (4 technical sessions, one hour each). Nothing special, almost everything was straightforward, except one of the question during the last interview (with a software engineer staff) was too specific.I could have answered better if I had more time to understand the question. I received positive feedback from the technical interviewers, but the final answer was a negative one.

First I gave them my CV and got an answer after a week, asking me for a 1 hour phone interview in 2 weeks. I waited 2 weeks after the phone interview to get an answer asking me to assist to the final round, a face to face interview day (consisting of 4 interviews) in Monterrey, Mexico. I got the results in place one hour after the 4 interviews. Microsoft is very well organized in their interviews and recruiters share all the information they have about you so you don't have to repeat any information. They always expect you to ask for feedback at the end of each interview and they even give you some training before the final round. I practiced with 10+ exercises and questions that I found in Glassdoor and read the whole "Programming Interviews Exposed" book before the final round. It is very recommended if you are a student or looking for an entry level position. I did not share all the questions that I had or the answers to them for privacy reasons.

I started the recruiting process by handing my resume to a recruiter at a job fair at my University. I then had a really easy on-campus screening. Following that I waited for about a month before they invited me for a interview in Redmond on April 2017. They flew me in into Redmond, rented a car for me and hosted me in a nice hotel. Early on the morning of the interviews I showed up at their recruiting center and they sent me to the team that was interviewing me. I had 5 long interviews, each lasting about an hour. Had a really positive experience, even if a couple of the interviewers decided to play devil's advocate trying to poke holes into my solutions. One of my interviewers was also a visiting engineering from China, which definitely made communication a bit hard. I got an official offer the next day after my interview.

Well! I can only say my interview experience was pretty bad and unprofessional with those guys. After I cracked the phone screening, they invited me for the onsite interview. The interviewers were pretty rude, trying to find bugs on my code sooo hard, not helpful at all and eventually looks like they had to accept my solutions unwillingly. I think I did pretty good job but looks like that's not enough interestingly to get the job. I noticed they already determined who to hire because the job was already closed !!! before I start my interview. So then why wasting my time? really Microsoft why? If you guys would tell me the reason honestly, I would be like OK and understand that! I'm pretty sure I would reject their offer if I had that since I wouldn't like to work such *** guys...

The process was very quick. Only a 30 min interview at a University. I personally found the interview to be unfair. He had asked a question on finding a piece of data in an array. He said my implementation was not good enough and to revise it. In order to revise it to be faster it is assumed all the data to be unique, that was not stated in the problem statement nor was it implied in anyway. The interviewer then felt the need to explain to me what binary search was and what O(logn) meant, and assumed I knew nothing. Overall more focus is placed on the ability to solve problems very fast than review the quality of the candidate in other aspects. In short, if you cannot do what they ask in a way they like you're not good enough.

The actual interview consisted of a phone interview and then four onsite interviews a few months later. But, between these two events, plenty of information was shared on how to do as well as possible. You definitely get encouraged to do as well as possible and any questions you may have get answered. The onsite interviews were all 45 minutes and were held in a single day. I made the mistake of not having breakfast that day, which I would definitely not repeat if I had to go through the process again. The whole process was very pleasant, though at times surreal.

The questions were mostly what you would expect after reading Glassdoor and Cracking the Coding Interview. The phone interview had a simple logic puzzle at the end. Although you can easily find these online, there's no need to memorize them since they aren't hard to go through and if you're vocal about your thought process, the interviewer may steer you in the right direction. The onsite interviews were a mix between technical (implement this) and theoretical (how would you...) questions. For the technical ones you can be well prepared by understanding Cracking the coding interview, while for the theoretical ones you mostly need a little bit of experience and imagination.   Answer Question

They asked really easy questions about int arrays and trees, and I wrote code on white boards. I chatted with each of them to learn a bit about their works. Some projects were rather surprising.

(The answer: yes, choose the one falsely labeled "both" to determine its true label then work backwards to get the other two) The in-person interview consisted of me going from building to building interviewing with a bunch of different people one-on-one.

After that, I wrote the version one code and discuss with interviewer about the optimization. All interviewers are really nice and willing to help.

First halve had multiple choice questions testing basic knowledge of mostly Data structures and algorithms, and a few question from other areas like operating systems and networks. Second stage was a so called "group-flyer" round. In this stage candidates screened through first stage were divided into groups of 7-10 and each group was made to seat in a different rooms of our tutorial block. Then two programming questions were written on the blackboards of each room and we were asked to write the solution code on the paper and submit. Third stage consisted of usual interview rounds. One had to progress through the rounds. Those who were finally selected had three to four rounds of interviews.

- Technical test composed of 8 questions in 2 hours on hackerrank.com. 1 question on probability, 1 question on algorithms, 6 coding questions; mainly on arrays, linked-lists and BST as well as a math problem. - Invited for an onsite technical interview, It was at least 3 interviews. First Interview was about algorithms and how to solve a problem till you write its code. Second was a design interview, mainly about OOP. I couldn't pass the second interview, so I don't know what the third interview was supposed to be about.

1) Array of length n, its elements are x-powers of the range (1 to n+1). There is one repeated element, find it. - The interviewer helps you till you reach the final solution, but he keeps asking about time and space complexity of each move you do. He may ask you to implement system functions like pow, sqrt and so on.   Answer Question 2) Can static functions work on non-static members?   Answer Question 3) Design a logger class.   Answer Question 4) What's n-tier applications?   Answer Question

Got the interview through a recruiter that contacted me on Linkedin. First Skype interview, 1 hr, 20 min. general questions about my cv then 40 min for three coding exercises. After this an on site interview: three interviewers, almost an hour each in their offices. All about programming on the whiteboard. Very different from each other.

At the beginning the usual ones: given a string shuffle it so that no two same letters are together. Sorting with low memory and its space/time complexity. Given a random list of integers write a function that returns sets taken from the list such that the sum of these numbers is equal (if possible). A lot of abstract questions about the fundamentals (sort etc.) and some very tricky ones about how to design efficient algorithms to enumerate some special type of linked lists.   Answer Question

Interviewed on campus at uni, recruiter asked me to debug the code written by the previous interviewee. Then we talked about what it was like to work at Microsoft and what questions I had about working at Microsoft.

The interviewer had the code from the previous interviewee still on the white board in the room. He asked me to identify what the code did (printed the contents of a binary tree through a BFS using a queue). Then asked me to identify the bugs with the code and suggest how to fix it (null-pointer exceptions when printing out the values from the queue and checking for nulls before adding a value to the queue).   Answer Question

After the CV screening, they sent me a doodle to select a convenient date and time for the phone screening. They informed me that technical questions should be included. The day of the interview, I received a punctual Skype call by a young lady, who although kind, seemed like she didn't enjoy her job a lot. She was very mechanical and showed no interest in getting to know me. I have had a lot of interviews this month and I understand that Microsoft interviews hundreds of people but I believe that this "robotic" behavior is a reflection of the company. I am waiting for the results of the phone interview but I think I have lost my interest in working for them.

I gave my resume to a recruiter at my school's career fair. Got an email back and had a 30 minute interview at my school's career center. In the interview, we mostly just talked about interests and general questions about data structures. The coding problem was to implement a linked list. I passed that interview and was flown out to Seattle for final round interviews. They pay for everything they can and then reimburse you for everything else, including food and a small stipend for site seeing, so the trip was great. The day of the interview everyone showed up at 7:30am for a quick breakfast (fruit, rolls, bagels, etc) in a common area. There were about 40 other candidates being interviewed during that time. About 60% female, 40% male. And about 60% Indian, 25% Asian, and 15% Caucasian. Then we each had four 45 minutes interviews, with 15 minute breaks between each one. Two of the interviewers are from one team in Microsoft and the other two are from another team. They make hiring decisions independent of one another so you could theoretically get offers from both teams (or none). Of the four of us interview candidates from my university, we all seemed to be interview by entirely different teams. (How they determined what teams you would be interviewing with was somewhat of a mystery to us.) Unfortunately for me, both the teams I interviewed with were in charge of back-end development. And I let both of them know that I had zero desire for that. Front-end all the way. After the interviews, we were taken over to another building on their campus for lunch. Lots of places to choose from and the campus is really nice. Overall, I think the best part was staying in the fancy hotel and going to the space needle and big Ferris wheel but I guess those parts are very aside from the actual objective of it all.

I applied through an on-campus event at my university and had an on-campus interview a few days after. The interviewer on campus asked me about my projects on my resume and asked a fairly simple algorithm question. I received an email a week later inviting me for an onsite interview. Because of the sheer number of candidates being interviewed, however, it took a few months to actually schedule the on-site interview. The on-site interview consisted of an initial interview with a recruiter and then 5 rounds with engineers, including a lunch interview. The interviewers asked me a wide variety of questions related to strings and arrays, and sometimes design questions. The interviewers were friendly for the most part. I got the no offer response from the recruiter a few days later, unfortunately.

I talked to the recruiter at the on-campus career fair. I was scheduled for a 45 minute on-campus interview the following week. The interview started with background talks, interests and chit chat for 15 minutes. I was then asked to write a code on paper and discuss my solution. The interviewer gave inputs on the code and suggested possible improvements. I made my code better and more effective twice but the interviewer expected more. By the time I realized how could I do better, there was not enough time to code, so he asked me to explain to him verbally on our way out. I got an email in next 1-2 weeks inviting me for an on-site interview that will be the final round. After another 3 weeks, I went to Redmond. The interview started at 8 am and comprised of 4 rounds, each of 45 minutes, with a 15 minute break in between. Each round was with a separate interviewer. Everyone asked a bit about resume and projects and then had one question for me to do white board programming. I had good vibes and was expecting a positive response but I was not expecting the results to be given the very next day. :)

4 technical rounds, where they don't ask anything other than code. No introduction, no profile, they just start with coding problems. First a design problem will be given for which you need to write code as well later. The worst part is they only ask 1question, there is no second chance. In case you took time in answering question but you answered correct then also they may reject. How they assess candidates on programming skills on just 1 question is wierd.

An initial phone interview was scheduled with a HR recruiter. I was asked basic technical questions and CV based questions with one or two common puzzles. I had literally no idea on how the recruiter was checking my answers to technical answers. It felt so lame because the recruiter had no technical knowledge and so if your answers don't hit the right keywords present in the sheet, then your losing half the game. It felt like the recruiter was somewhat forced to interview me and had no interest in my application. I answered almost 95% questions correctly if you would ask a technical guy but sadly I was being interviewed by a robot who was looking for only keywords hits. Very disappointing interview to say the least from a company like Microsoft. Very unprofessional the way the interview was carried with no self introduction to who I was talking to, I even had no idea that I was being interviewed by a recruiter with no technical knowledge.

Two phone interviews. One was technical. Flew out for on-site (Redmond). The campus is beautiful. The recruiter was professional. The team was friendly.

The accommodations are nice and the interview day wasn't as intense as other companies. I think moving around between offices helps relieve some stress between sessions. All questions are technical, although a couple of the interviewers did ask non-tech (about my resume). The lunch interview was strange, definitely not just a sit-and-eat with light conversation.

The entire process was extremely professional and positive. Microsoft really goes out of their way to welcome you and make you feel comfortable during the interview process.

The types of questions they asked were in "Cracking the Coding Interview" (which is an outstanding study guide).

I was contacted multiple times via LinkedIn to apply for a hiring event. I took the online tech screen and was told that I passed. At the event I had four interviews. Three were straight forward: here's a simple problem, write code to solve it on the whiteboard. The other interview was awful. The interviewer kept insisting that I hadn't passed the online tech screen, and asked me subjective questions that he had terrible answers for. He told me several things about specific programming languages that were false. My impression was that he used to write code, but was terrible at it and was promoted to management. Later I asked him what his role on the project was, and he rambled about the project without answering the question. He was also unprofessional, he answered emails on his phone while I answered his questions, at one point he yelled at me while I was trying to answer his question, and he slammed the door as he left. I was professional and courteous to him and tried to answer his questions. The real icing on the cake was that no one followed up with me after the interview. It has been weeks and not even a courtesy phone call or email. Obviously I wouldn't want to work here after my interview experience. I would strongly discourage software engineers from attending these hiring events.

At first I was enrolled into their internal employee referral system, thanks to help from my friends. 1 month later I was told that my resume didn't raise any interest and I thought I have been rejected. But days after that another recruiter contacted me. The entire process from phone interview arrangement, on-site interview to final feedback lasts another 1 month. I had 1 phone interview with simple C++ question. And for the on-site interview I met 5 interviewers at Redmond site. It started with a brief conversation with the recruiter. After that the first interviewer took me to lunch and then just interview me after lunch. All the interviews are conducted in a meeting room. There's one 30min break in the afternoon, and for that break I had to exit the office area and just wait and relax at the reception lobby. The difficulty of the interview questions are slightly above average, but fair enough for this position. Because C++ has not been my working language for 2 years, one of my friend who works at Microsoft suggested me to interview with my working language instead. But just in case I still practiced C++ for some days before on-site. And I was right, because all of the interviewers asked me to use C++ for white board coding. I was also told that Microsoft usually replies fast after interview, and that's true for my case. Just 1 week after on-site the recruiter called me and told me that they will not continue the process. He also told me that my biggest flaw was the fluency of C++. Despite they're aware of the fact that C++ has not been my working language for 2 years, from hindsight it seems to me that Microsoft really emphasize on the proficiency of C/C++/C# despite other qualification, which I'll definitely take extra care before my next application to Microsoft.

Interview process starts with 1) Phone interview followed by 2) onsite. My onsite happened in Vancouver consisting of 5 Technical interviews. 3 were technical and 1 was behavorial.

Received a mail about 1 month after applying online to set up a phone interview. The phone interview was pretty simple, and lasted for about 45 minutes. The interviewer just asked about my projects on my Resume. I received a mail within 3 days saying that u cleared the phone interview and inviting my to the Redmond office for an onsite interview. However, the actual onsite interview took place only after 2 months because of the sheer number of candidates they were interviewing. The onsite interview consisted of 3 rounds (including a lunch interview). They asked me about some design questions and some related to Trees and Lists. Two days later, I received a mail from the recruiter that I didn't clear the interview.

I had two on-site interviews, probably because they knew that I am a local. The first interview was rather brief and informal; basically the same as a technical phone screen, but in person. The second was a full-day onsite with five engineers. I also had lunch with some non-technical people with whom I would potentially be working on the same team.

Because I was applying for a full-stack web dev role, two of my interviewers were back-end engineers, so they asked a lot of SQL questions.   Answer Question

I dropped off my resume at a Microsoft recruiting event on my university campus. I was called in for a quick 30 minute on-campus interview that included both behavioral and technical elements. A few weeks later I flew out to Seattle and became part of a very large recruiting machine. There were two main interview rounds, morning and afternoon; each applicant was placed into one or the other and got 3-4 in-person one-on-one interviews, at 45 minutes each. Food was provided on site (lunch in the cafeteria, and snacks in the recruiting waiting room). All 4 of my onsite interviews were technical. Many interviewers asked me how I deal with difficult people when working in groups - I guess that's pretty important at Microsoft :P There were probably around 75 applicants total the day I was there. You get taxi vouchers and a small sightseeing allocation, which is nice. Microsoft pays for two nights of hotel stays, and distributes its candidates across a large number of nearby hotels for some reason.

Brief technical in person interview and then an onsite interview. The onsite was the most impersonal experience I've ever had with a company. There were around 40 of us there and interviewers would walk into the room and find us by name then lead us to a separate interview room. I should have had 4 rounds of technical interviews, but one interviewer did not show up so I had 3. I was only asked technical questions, very little about my background, and two of my interviewers were very open about how they had not even looked at my resume. You don't know what team you're interviewing with until you get there. HR does the typical "So... Do you have any other offers?" thing. But what Microsoft lacked in personality, they made up for by completely showering us in money. Seriously, they give you the means to spoil yourself while you're there!

Given a directory string "c/a/../b/./d" write a method that outputs the final directory. (In this example, "c/b/d"). A "." input stays in the current directory, a ".." input goes back one.   1 Answer Design a method midNumbers(start, end, length) that prints the middle values between two integers. Ex: midNumbers(0,5,2) would print 2,3. midNumbers(1,10,4) would print 4,5,6,7. This question was left VERY vague and I think it was intentionally left up to the interviewee to clarify as much as possible. Follow ups included "How would you check for appropriate input? How would you protect against attacks, such as a buffer overflow attack? What are some cases that you would test to check that the method is working correctly?"   Answer Question How would you convert a row number on Excel to a label? Rows are labeled alphabetically with letters added on once the alphabet has been fully used.

During phone talk we discussed my past experience, my approaches to solve problems and I was asked to solve one algorithmic problem.

The on-campus interview was pretty much just a screening to make preliminary cuts. The interviewer asked me a couple questions about my resume then we went straight to a technical question which was pretty easy. About 2-3 weeks later I got an email saying that I made it on to the final round at Microsoft's campus.

Very simple process, one on campus and then 4 rounds of 45 minute interviews in Seattle. They started off the interviews with a short discussion of what they do and ask me about myself and what im interested in, then they dive into coding problems. I have written some of the coding problems below

1) Reverse C style string, given a pointer. Make sure the pointer is still pointing to the same spot at the end of it. 2) Given 4 teams and 3 gamedays, create an algorithm such that each team plays another team every gameday and by the end of the 3 gamedays each team should have played one game with every other team. The algorithm shouldnt be hardcoded, needs to create a relatively random matchup (Use graph theory)   Answer Question

Entire process lasted about 4 weeks. Applied at college career fair and was invited for first round interviews on campus. Got through to the onsites scheduled about 3 weeks later at Redmond, WA. Onsite interviews consisted of 4 rounds and interviewers are usually from the team that will be hiring. Got an offer about 3 days later. A big tip for candidates would be to treat the interviews like a regular discussion with a friend/colleague. Interviewers are very friendly and they love talking to candidates. Also, always be honest. If you are asked a very familiar question, let them know!

Initial round: simple question on pattern matching. Onsites: graphs based questions, arithmetic conversion question, LRU cache implementation etc.   Answer Question

Had an awesome time. All the interviewers were extremely friendly and all seemed genuinely interested in talking about the previous projects I've worked on.

I applied during Microsoft campus recruitment event at my university. On the first day we sat for 2 online rounds- 1st one was an MCQ round focused on OS, Data structures, & details of C/C++ & JAVA programming languages. The questions were quite challenging. After that there was a coding round where 2 questions on data structures & simple graph theory had to be solved. This round was surprisingly easy. After a day's gap the selected candidates were called for P.I's. There were several rounds spread over 2 days including a group round(not a group discussion though). Very high emphasis was placed on data structures, algorithms but they also wanted to test our ability to analyze & frame a solution( even if that solution is not the optimal one) for some open ended problems. The interviewers were quite friendly & helped out when they felt a liile nudge in the right direction was needed. One suggestion, brush up on more "advanced" data structures like Tries, segment trees, red black trees, interval tree etc.. If you can demonstrate a good grasp over these topics, the interviewers seem to be impressed.

This was for the Hololens team. Got the job via a head hunter from Seattle area from the company "Experis IT". He managed to screw up the whole interview with the project lead of the holo lens team in Microsoft. Microsoft constantly uses third-party recruiting agencies to get their people. These agencies will only take Canadian citizens and will not sponsor you for any visa if you require one. The interview was 1st telephonic and then I was an international candidate going from Vancouver to Seattle. The recruiting agency nor microsoft paid for my travel to the interview which was the 2nd round, in person. This was a white board question (question details below). The interviewers were in a haste and didn't actually know about my interview. I was left in the lobby for 1.15 hour with no food or water, since I was just an interviewee. I had travelled by train from Vancouver (Canada) to Seattle for a 1 hour whiteboard test which Microsoft was strict about. In total I travel-led 17 hours for a 1 hour interview with Microsoft and it was horrible. I advice that whoever goes to such interviews from Canada to US, ask all details to the original head hunting agencies like: 1. How many rounds will the interview be. 2. How much commission will be cut from your salary (yes commission is taken from the employee's salary on a monthly basis) 3. You are mostly underpaid compared to what normal US citizens are paid. 4. If its a contract to hire, its a risk, what can the recruiting agency do to resolve Visa issues. 5. Search W2- Payroll. Hope it helps. This is a Game Dev / related position using game engine.

Was recruited through a university job fair. Received an on-campus interview in two weeks. On-campus was a joke. Aside from cultural questions, they asked me to write a shuffle function... in Python. Aced that one. Waited a month with no interaction. Finally, they sent me an email telling me they wanted to fly me out in November. Flew me out, gave me a full day to rest before the interview started. The interview was supposed to be four parts but they messed up my shuttle schedule so they actually brought me to their campus an hour late. They said it was their bad so don't worry about it. I ended up only taking three of the four parts of the interview, though. I believe it was supposed to be two tech and two cultural but I ended up taking two tech and one cultural. Questions weren't terribly difficult, but in retrospect there were definitely "better" solutions than those that I provided. Likely using dynamic programming and the like. I was under pressure so I just defaulted to techniques I was more used to. Cultural questions were difficult to gauge since I wasn't sure what they were looking for. Some examples of questions include "If we just released a game and it received a 50 on Metacritic, what would you do to improve that score?" and stuff like that.

Imagine a bejeweled board. Every turn, the game must check if a row of n length of valid jewels have been formed or not. If it has been, it must remove and update the board. Write a function that can check for the board every turn for valid rows to remove.   Answer Question

Short phone conversation with recruiter/HR, which lead to a Skype-based technical screening/interview. After passing the technical screen, I was flown out to Seattle for on-site interviews. Two one-on-one interviews in the morning, followed by a lunch-based "team-fit" interview, then an afternoon interview with the hiring manager. Each interview was roughly an hour long, with a short break between each.

Very pleasant interview process. Since I'm about to graduate with a PhD, I interviewed with two teams: one a very research-y team, and the other a software development team. Both interviews were extremely pleasant. The interviewers were genuinely nice, and allowed me plenty of time for me to ask them questions about the team and the role I would play. In terms of actual questions, the research-y team had most of the interviewers asking me about my ideas on the research problems they were trying to solve, with only one actual "coding" interview, which dealt with the standard tree traversal questions, and the design for a battleship game, with the challenge question being about how to scale up the battleship game to a large grid. The other team had more coding style questions, but most of them were not about writing code per se, but more of designing data structures and algorithms to solve specific problems in distributed sorting, google doc style spreadsheets, etc. Lots of puzzle/brainteaser questions from this team as well. Overall, a great interview experience!

Initial step was a 30-minute on-campus interview at my university. From there, took actually quite a while (3+ weeks) to hear anything back. This delay was the only negative part of the process in my eyes. Once I heard back, they set up a date and confirmed that it would work with my schedule. They flew me out, gave me a great hotel room, rental car and reimbursement for food. Despite the rental car, a bus was available on the morning of the interview to bring me to Microsoft's campus so I didn't have to worry about driving. The interview itself consisted of lunch, followed by 4 45-minute interviews. Between each interview was a 15 minute break to get snacks and drinks - this was extremely helpful in making this process easier. Afterwords, the recruiter informed me that I would hear back by the end of that week, and then actually got back even earlier than that - this was great as I didn't spend a long time waiting for a response like with other companies. Very well done interview process.

I did that, and received a link for online tech screen. Recruiter was supposed to have a chat with me before that, but he never called on the scheduled time, and didn't even bother to follow up. So I took the test without instructions, it was pretty easy one, I was able to finish in half time. Then I sent email to recruiter asking if he can follow up and he said that his calendar was broken (that's weird, Microsoft can't provide reliable calendars, was it Outlook calendar). Then I received the automated reply saying that I didn't pass the tech screen which is just weird. It's the last time I'm dealing with microsoft. Better spend more time and prepare for Google, at least they are professional and organized and treat candidates with respect.

I had a short telephone interview setup. The interview was a technical interview and my interests and passions. Once I cleared that, I had a full day interview in Microsoft main campus. There were a total of 5 interviews including the final one with the hiring manager. The interviews were technical questions focusing on programming questions. The questions were related to data structures and algorithms and not really programming language specific. There were testing questions at the end of interview too.

I had an interview on campus in Fall 2014 for an internship, but they emailed me back and told me that while the interview went well, they didn't have any positions available at the time. I thought it was just a really nice way of saying "thanks, but no thanks." Fast forward to Fall 2015, when my recruiter emailed me and asked me if I would like to go to Redmond for interviews since the on campus interview went well last year. I went, and I must say that I was very impressed with Microsoft. They drove us potential University Recruits to their campus in a Limo! The interview process was four 45-minute interviews in a row, with a 15 minute break between each one. I was surprised that I was being interviewed for a group that did higher level programming even though I have studied more low-level programming in recent years because I'm a Computer Engineering student. I think some of the other interviewees who were looking for higher level jobs were confused too, because they interviewed most of them for the operating systems track. I'm not sure if there was a mix-up or not! The interviews themselves were very engaging and the interviewers presented challenging questions. I strongly suspect that one of the people who was interviewing me was texting while I had my back turned and was talking through a problem on the whiteboard, but the rest of it went pretty well. I didn't get an offer, but I'm glad I went.

It was described to me to be split into three parts. First of all there was a quick chat with the recruiter who basically digested the CV with me as reference so that he could then present it to the hiring manager. The hiring manager was interested and then there was a telephone interview organised. This was mostly just a general chat about experience and then a very small technical element. Unfortunately I was super super prepared for a problem solving question but he simply asked "How does the internet work?", which took me completely by surprised and I answered terribly. Still I personally am not sure about asking that question for someone who is all about problem solving. Also its a question that could be answered after about 5 minutes of Google-ing! With regards to the recruiter though, he was excellent, super responsive and eager to help!

The whole process, from applying online to getting the results of my interview, took four weeks. After applying online I was contacted about doing a phone interview a few days later. The phone interview was with a team lead who was pleasant, asked me a little about myself, asked me a straight forward programming question and then describe the team. After I got the thumbs up from the phone interview Microsoft made arrangements for me to fly up and stay in a hotel for two nights to do an on-site interview a week and a half later. The on-site interview was for four and a half hours with four interviews, each with a different senior developer or team lead. All four asked a coding question which weren't exceptionally difficult, but were challenging enough. As I talked through the problems they helped me along the way, which made me feel uneasy about how well I was doing, which made it worse. After a week I received word that they were going to decline on an offer and I could apply again in six months.

It is college recruiting. The first interview was in college about 1 hour, one coding problem about sorting, just write the pseudo code in a paper, not so difficult, the pressure is timing. Then asked some questions about projects in my resume, and questions like how do you think to improve some Microsoft products like IE etc. Three weeks later I was informed they will fly me to Redmond for onsite interview. I flied from Florida and stayed at Seattle for two nights, Microsoft paid all the trip. The first night is a big dinner party with all other candidates over the country and Microsoft managers/employees who will interview us the next day. The dinner is not interview, just casual party with chatting, get familiar with each other, very friendly. At next day all candidates are divided into two groups, interviewed by morning and afternoon separately. I was in afternoon group, the morning is a bus tour for the Microsoft campus, meeting and talking with HR and engineers, introduced the Microsoft life, sports center, science center etc, they want you to like here, treated like we are one of them already. Actually the HR told us once you are on campus interview, that means basically you are qualified to Microsoft, but they only hire top half of us due to high competitiveness. Afternoon interview has 4 turns, about 1 hour each with different development manager. Each turn has coding question of course, write the pseudo code in white board. They are not very difficult, once you are in good hand in algorithm class, it should be OK, the timing and efficiency is the key. Remember I said they only hire top half of the group, solve as many coding questions as you can in one hour with better efficiency, then you will stand out to the top half. I worked OK to the first and second turn, the managers are friendly, and asked question like how do you think about Microsoft, any question/expectation to Microsoft/product etc. But I failed at third turn, my coding solution looks complicated and inefficient, although I worked out, the manager pointed that and introduced better one to me, of course that means mine is not that good. The fourth turn means nothing then, the interviewer not on the interview mood at all, just asked some unimportant coding/question to pass the time. So the result is obvious. All of us know the result right after the interview finished. They call the failed candidate one by one out of the room and told you very regretfully then you can leave. And the other half who still left in the room are offered... This is college hiring, all the candidates are undergraduate/graduate, the experienced one may be different and more difficult. Someone said since the 4 managers are from different team, if one or two are interested in you, then you may be hired, but by my experience that is not true, you have to pass by all 4 to get offer. The key is practice of coding problems consistently, from easy to hard, in short timing and good efficiency which make you competitive.

Write code to check if a given binary tree is a binary search tree ( gave the solution using in-order traversal but the interviewer thinks that the code is hard to read and isn't maintainable and writes a line of code using the Enumerable class of C# He then goes on for 30 minutes on a NP complete problem and did not have a clear idea of what he was asking, " we use constraints" and "these are problems open discussions" were the 2 phrases iterated throughout A negative experience

I applied at an in person hiring event at the University of Central Florida. About a 3 weeks later I received an email saying that I was chosen to follow up with the first round of the interviews which took place at my campus. The recruiting staff traveled back to my school interview all the candidates. A month later I received another email saying I moved on to the second round of interviews which took place at their main campus in Seattle, WA. They paid for all my travel and living expenses for the 3 day trip. I was allowed to the choose the arriving and departing dates from several options they gave me. Once I arrived to Seattle they gave me a day to explore the city on my own and the other day was used almost entirely for interviews (although they do let you out around 4pm to do more exploring). I went through three interviews with different employees from the Microsoft Office team which each lasted about an hour long. They all seemed to press firmly on the matter of testing code. Questions like: "How would you test this code?", "Did you ever run any tests to make sure it worked?", "How do you know this code works?". Not all the interviews started out that way, but they did end like that.

Given a regular phone number dial pad, write code that will list out all the possible letter combinations that can be made given three numerical digits as input. For example, the base function would look like this: function numberToChars(int *numbers) {    // would return an array of different character combinations    // if input was 123    // output: adg, adh, adi, bdg, etc... }   1 Answer How would you test a function this function and make sure it works? The function would take in two file paths as parameters and then copy the contents of the first file path into the second one?   Answer Question

It was an entire day meeting with managers from a variety of teams. The interview was quite grueling, but fair. They are extremely focused on ensuring that they hire top talent, so they understandably want to be thorough about it. Be prepared to do a LOT of whiteboard coding. You need to be able to explain performance characteristics, code testability, feasibility of algorithms in a production environment, etc. There will be quite a lot of conversation about CS fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms. Strongly recommend pulling out some college textbooks or going through some interview preparation material if you don't feel confident about these things. Some of the problems are designed to be almost impossible to solve in the time provided - they are more interested in seeing your thought process, so don't get too frustrated during the process.

I was contacted by a Microsoft recruiter (who by the way gave me one of the worst customer experiences. The response time for each email was minimum of 3 days! ) who found a team for me to interview. I did not know that there was a Microsoft policy (and I was educated of this via my recruiter), that Microsoft does not schedule an interview more than 14 days in advance. So 14 days before I actually wanted to schedule an interview I contacted the recruiter. After being assured that my interview was scheduled, I applied for brief break from work. The interview did not happen when I had taken a leave of absense (so time off wasted!). I feel getting a good recruiter to work with is an important thing with Microsoft. There was a 45 min phone screen. There were 5 onsite interviews. 4 techincal and 1 hiring manager. I did not get an offer because the hiring manager said I had a lot of UI experience and the team had another candidate who had more backend experience. The hiring manager requested the recruiter to help me find another position but I did not pursue as the recruiter was a pain to work with.

I interviewed with Microsoft when I was in college. I went through 2 phone interviews after which they asked me to fly down to Redmond for more technical interviews. The phone interviews were a combination of both behavioral as well as technical questions. I felt the technical questions on the phone were a lot simpler than the ones on their campus. The level of difficulty for on-campus interviews varied a lot. My first interview (which was with a Test Manager) was the most difficult one while the other interviews (with Test Leads and SDET 2) seemed significantly easier.

I submitted my resume both at a college career fair and online. When I got to was invited to the on-campus interview, they told me I would be applying for a position with MSIT. This took me aback at first, but the interviewer said I would be working as a developer, so I decided to continue with the interview process when they invited me to fly out for another round in Redmond. The process of scheduling the interview was a bit difficult and I ended up going right in the middle of my semester final exams because they couldn't accommodate another time. That said, they were very attentive and detail-oriented when it came to scheduling drivers and hotels to make my trip as painless as possible. The day of the interview I went with a group of other prospective interns to the campus recruiting building at Microsoft, where we got a brief introduction to the interview process and were then sent off to our first individual interviews. There were 4 interviews in total, with each interview clocking in around 45 minutes and involving a mix of interpersonal and technical questions. Interviewers drew on my resume to find starting points for the different technical questions, and though I often felt like I didn't quite reach some of the conclusions they were after, I had great conversations with the interviewers about the challenges involved in each one. I received an offer two weeks later and accepted shortly thereafter.

Fast paced at the beginning of the interview process (5 interviews over the first week, with 2 interviews per day), then there was a silent period, then there was an even longer silent period, then the on-site round email came to my inbox. I did the on-site round over Skype due to some visa issues. The quality of the treatment was lowering as the time went by. I remember the guy in the intro interview showing me some cool features of Bing Images service under deployment at the moment (I was very excited watching all that stuff), and I still remember this very same guy in the last interview on the on-site round telling me: "You have good coding skills but you're not good for solving problems, and we need someone that can solve problems" in a tone that denoted his annoyance because I couldn't give him a good answer. It was very rude from him to tell me that considering that I solved the problems in the 7 previous interviews, but well.

Referred by friend. Took a standard coding question on phone. 2 days on-site interview. 1 day for HR only, 1 day for techniques. 2 Technique interview, 1 lunch, then told me you'd better begone. I was very unlucky. I know senior guys in Microsoft tend to ask puzzles, I met a senior like this. Furthermore, he was in VERY BAD MOOD. Because of Friday? My current job is despised like a baby game for him. He kept yelling why you do NOT know this windows system function, why you do NOT answer my question in the way I like. And he explained his work with a stupid pride. Overall, background not matching. Completely waste of time. But it is my fault at first place. I should not even apply, as a pure Linux application developer and Windows-hater. More sadly, all the technical questions in the first 5 pages of Glassdoor Microsoft interview are not asked. So it is hard to know how to prepare.

He explained the role the best he could, asked me a few simple data structure related questions and once I passed that, scheduled a phone screen with someone from the team. The phone screen was probably the hardest interview of them all. The coding question was simple, however, I came up with a non-optimal solution. I was able to rework the whole solution to an optimal one in the end. Next, he asked me some OS concepts that were pretty generic and you should know from any undergrad OS course you should have taken. Since I'd used Java as my coding language, he was wary of my abilities to handle pointers. He asked me about it and I told him that it'd been a while since I'd used them, however I was willing to answer any questions he had to test my knowledge on it. He asked me a data structure manipulation question (it shows up on many interview reviews posted here) using pointers. I had 5 minutes remaining on the call, so I did the best I could. He seemed satisfied with the solution and passed me. The on-site interviews: I drove to the office with the rental car they provided me and waited in the lobby for the recruiter. He spoke to me about what the day would look like and what I should expect. He explained that there were 4 tech interviews scheduled and if those went well, there would be a fifth one with a high-level manager. The first interview was easy, nothing much to report. Next was a lunch interview. I ended up answering all his questions and only then ate so as to not get distracted. Was a decent pizza from the cafeteria too. :) The third interview was a simple data structure manipulation question. No way that any decent CS major could screw this up. After the coding, he asked me a LOT of OS related questions. The fourth interview (and what I feared would be my last one) was the best one of the lot. The guy was pretty high up in the team and has so much energy. He started off with explaining his background and what the team does in great detail. He also asked me about my last three rounds and what I thought went well or what I could have done better. His coding question was fairly easy and I took my time and asked clarifying questions to make sure I knew exactly what he wanted. The last thing I wanted to do was screw up an easy question with a senior team member. I did end up getting to the fifth round. This was the most relaxed of the lot and the manager spoke a lot about the culture in the company and answered a lot of my questions about the role and the team. Just remember that if you can't think of asking any questions, explain that you've already asked question X or Y and this is your understanding. Sitting there with a blank expression just makes the interviewer think that you're not really interested in the role since he doesn't know what you've asked the other interviewers. After the last interview, he escorted me out of the building while we made small talk. He said that the recruiter will get back to me by possibly tomorrow. But this point, I guessed that their hiring decision was made and it was up to the recruiter to get back to me in his own time. As I sat in my car in the parking lot, I sent the recruiter an email thanking him for being very helpful and responsive through the process and that it was a pleasure working with him. A few notes: in case you didn't know, the company laid off a huge number of testers last year in their org restructuring, therefore, all devs should take on the responsibility of testing their own code thoroughly. I had this at the back of my mind and made sure that every line of code was tested as well as every corner case was at least discussed, if not taken care of (sometimes you can't write all the error checking conditions in a short span of time). So, while it may seem that the questions were easy, without clarifying questions and high-coverage test cases, you will not get an offer. One last thing is have a lot of questions prepared: what exactly is the role's duties, what is the org structure, what is the deployment cycle and workflow. Even questions like what was their worst deployment and what happened shows an interest in how the team operates (not all questions have to be interviewer pleasing!) Above all, treat the interview like a conversation between new acquaintances/friends. They want to gauge if they want to sit in an office/cubicle across from you everyday, so that interest and camaraderie is important to them as much as it is to you. This will also relax you and improve your thought process since you'll respond to any hints they may give you in case you get stuck. Finally, have fun.

Since I signed an NDA, I will not really post any questions. But I can tell you that you need your data structures down pat (not red-black trees or anything that complex). While you can memorize all the questions and algorithms out there, understanding the high level aspects of them (backtracking, dynamic programming, simple string manipulation, etc.) pays off when you encounter a question you've never seen before. Third, you need to know what your team does to know what they can ask. If it's a system development role, you need to brush up on your OS fundamentals, networking etc. Finally, prepare for any behavioral questions you could be asked. There are a ton out there online and they pretty much cover all the ground. Linking these answers to specific projects on your resume is certain bonus points.   Answer Question

Phone Interview with a guy who was a technical recruiter. Pretty casual, asked some generally questions about background and technical questions. He started out asking about my resume, why I want the position, etc. Then asked me some general questions about software engineering principles. He asked me about a project I have worked on, how did I go about programming it, what kinds of challenges/bugs did I face. Then asked some technical questions. Then finally I had the opportunity to ask him questions.

A recruiter called me to schedule a phone screen technical interview with a developer team lead. The technical interview was supposed to be an hour but lasted an hour and a half; the team lead was very interested in my project work, and the overall impression was very positive, even though no coding was tested during the phone screen. Before I stepped into the office, I got the e-mail request for me to fly to Seattle and meet the team the following week. Scheduling was very easy to work with and I had no issues getting to Seattle; a rental car was even booked for me, and meals and parking can be expensed. The first interview was with the recruiter, who was very friendly and provided some insightful information on how the interviews work and a schedule with the people I would meet. She also mentioned that there were multiple teams monitoring these interviews and that if I did well in the interviews there would be additional interviews that were not on the schedule. While there was a lunch interview that was a bit more casual (no whiteboard = no coding), I didn't let my guard down; all other interviews were highly technical and required coding or analyzing code. I eventually met double the number of people I was scheduled for and the interviews lasted 7 hours. It was a gruelling day, and one interviewer asked me questions outside of my knowledge zone, but it was extremely insightful as to the difficulty level of a first-tier software tech company interview, and I learned a lot of what was being expected at Microsoft.

Phone interview, followed by on-campus interview. Real meat is in the on-location interview though. Essentially, from 8-5 I met with various current employees of different ranks in the team I was going to work with. Questions were either standard conversation fair, probing the depths of your understanding of certain problems, standard algorithm-focused coding interviews, and even some pure brainteaser questions.

I mentioned I had done the AI for a video game. I told them I used A* for pathfinding, but when they probed me on it I admitted I used a library implementation, and didn't understand the algorithm in detail. I was then tasked with trying to derive it, knowing that it essentially boils down to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm + a bias.   1 Answer

I had an on-campus interview briefly after my school's career fair, then I was flown to Seattle for an on site. The on-campus interviewer didn't know what Haskell was, which really surprised me. Other than that it was a pretty easy technical question, and a few behavioral question. The on site interview in their headquarter was very organized, however my last interviewer told me "I know people can't think when interviewers stare at them, so I am gonna check my emails for a while while you code on the board, no need to talk through every line of code to me." which I found odd. And that was the interview I failed. The questions were all pretty standard, harder than the on campus one but still very manageable.

First interview was in University, they asked a matrix question from the "Cracking the programming interview" book. Afterwards they flew me to Redmond for the final round. They literally paid for everything: Hotel, flight, rental car, taxi, space needle ticket, meals and so on. During the day I had 5 interviews back to back. The questions are very standard but covers almost all data structures and algorithms. Still they are much easier than the ones i got from Google. Overall the interviewers are very nice and helpful. They made the interviews seem like a work place discussion rather than tests so i was very relaxed and confidently talked my way through it. Got an offer within a week.

The interview process took 8 weeks. I was referred by a friend and was contacted by an engineering manager first. We set up a phone screening for the week after. Then two weeks went by and then I was contacted by a recruiter. She wanted to setup a phone screening but then after a few weeks she told me the hiring manager wanted to go to on-site after hearing about my phone screening. Some how I got lost in the flow of things. They flew me out the next week, very short deadline and notice, for four interviews. After my fourth interview they tacked on a fifth. The last was with the hiring manager. He told me normally when he meets recruits it is a good thing so I should not worry, however he did not want to give out an offer yet. He wanted to see where to put me. He said I was good but not what he normally hirers, i.e. not a new grad or experienced professional. I was changing from teaching in Academia for five years. After I got back on Tuesday, I was informed on Wednesday night, 3 hour time difference, that my recruiter received my feedback and wanted to schedule a time to talk the next day. We talked on Thursday where she gave me an offer for SDEII. Very exciting. I did negotiate but not on the yearly salary or bonuses as they were very competitive and above what I was expecting.

I will abide by the NDA so I will not disclose the actual questions. I can say that I was asked some fairly tough questions. One was an actual problem they were asked to do, he should me the design requirements. The last of the four said she normally does not ask this difficult of a question but for me she would.

One on-campus interview scheduled by the designated university recruiter. Interviewed with a manager that was flown in to do technical interviews for a day on-campus. After passing this, there was a fly-out to Redmond (The Microsoft Experience). This was tons of fun and was almost like a mini-vacation but also nerve-wracking. There are so many people flying in every day of the week so there are many people to share the experience with. The interview day lasts the entire day and consists typically of five interviews 1.5 hours each including a lunch interview. A new recruiter helps take care of logistics for the fly-out. A different recruiter takes care of you for the whole day. They meet at the beginning and end to ensure you have the experience you are looking for. This recruiter makes contact directly about the result of the interviews soon after.

First round of phone screening was mainly talking about my background. I think the interviewer was from HR/Recruiting so was not very technical. You need to sell yourself in this round.

Labels on the baskets are jumbled. Find the correct baskets in one attempt by picking a fruit from any basket Advice: Impress your interviewer by marketing your skills well and back it up with the work you have done. I was flown in to Seattle and based in a Redmond hotel a night before my on-site interview. On the day of the interview a Microsoft cab picks you up from the airport and takes you to their Recruiting building. There were many other candidates, but they were mainly for internships. You meet with your designated recruiter who is your point of contact post-interview. As mentioned in other reviews, talk nicely with this recruiter and highlight your skill and more importantly your passion for Microsoft. This recruiter has a say in your final yes or no decision. Had 5 interviews on-site with 5 senior engineers/managers. Each interviewers experience at Microsoft progresivelly increased- ranging from 10 years to 25 years. Each interview is for 1 hour, in which the interviewer will talk about his role/experience for 10-15 minutes, ask about your experience for 10-15 minutes and the rest would be a coding question. These interviews were not exceptionally difficult. I felt and had heard that more than cracking every coding questions, at Microsoft, it is more about 1. Being very passionate and excited to join Microsoft 2. Writing clean quality code with comments, main driver function, corner cases, talking as you write and testing the code 3. Presenting yourself professionally. You have the write background if you ve made it on-site. Focus on that background, while continually showing your excitment about being there and wanting to join Microsoft. Have a solid answer to "Why Microsoft?" Ask them smart questions which show your thinking ability. Before starting to code on whiteboard, ask clarifying questions about the problem, talk about your design to the problem, point out any limitations. Start coding with proper comments, spaces, use good variable/functions names etc. You will hear back from the recruiter in 1-3 days. Microsoft gives a generous offer, with bonuses and RSUs, benifits, however, if you have a competing offer do negotiate. You will surely get a higher package.

During my last year at school, I contacted one of the recruiters on campus. She setup an interview on campus. It was a 45 minute interview. There were questions regarding my classes; projects; interests; some high-level questions on operation systems, version control, and design; and a couple simple programming questions. About six weeks later I went through the six hour interview process, where each 50 minute block was an interview with a current engineer.

There were two stages: rounds 1 and 2. The first round is done on the university campus, where they get to know you and assess your skills. I applied after a coding competition held on campus. This interview involved one technical question and some questions about my history. The interviewer simply wanted me to gush about who I am and what I'm proud of. Round 2 was a very different experience. This round they bring you to the Redmond campus for a set of interviews, I was flown out from Ottawa. There will be 3-5 interviews, depending on constraints. The interviewers all ask at least 1 technical question, and generally these questions cover your entire skillset. It's difficult if you're nervous, but if you go in with a good mood and no expectations you can get through fine.

They questions alternated between the interviewer seeming to think I was completely incompetent basic programming questions and normal fairly difficult technical interview questions. There is a good amount of emphasis on your past experience, and a decent amount of the harder problems only required pseudocode. It is 8am, and there are only minimal breaks between interviews, during which you sit in the lobby chatting with your fellow interviewees/competition.

This was an interview for another intern position after I had turned down my original re-offer. Microsoft required me to turn down my original team-specific offer to start another process with another team. As a result, they flew me out immediately to Redmond campus to interview with a particular team that they tell you the day of. Having worked with this group overall the previous summer, my interviewing experience was wonderful. The interviewers are insightful and are interested in the candidates. I must say that I have learned a lot from throwing around optimization ideas / product concepts / software architecture sketches with my interviewers. I was notified at the end of the day that I had an offer. However, the recruiter contacted me two weeks later stating that they had over-offered in terms of positions, and could no longer give me a position with the group I originally had interviewed with. They were helpful in finding another internship match in another team, taking my interests into account as much as possible. Since I was very specific about my internship topic that summer, I ultimately turned down the offer they gave me, but they were certainly accommodating in trying to amend for the mistake on their part.

Phone call after applying. Quick behavioral questions. Final question about 9 marbles, 1 heavier than all of them, find it using a 2 plate scale. Get an email inviting me to fly out a month later. They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly. Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure. But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them. Technical questions were: -Implement circular array with a k-step elimination -Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum -Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix -Without knowing the size of an array, find an element. Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized. The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part. Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable.

All expense paid trip to Redmond. Flew me in, stayed 3 days 2 nights in a sweet hotel, rental car, fancy meals, the works. The on site interview was with 4 engineers from the same team. 45 minute interviews with each one. Most of them were simple conversations. If you make it to this round it's basically a culture fit. They didn't ask a single code question and none of those stupid "How many golf balls fit in a school bus" type questions. The whole team was really good. Less than a week later the recruiter contacted me with an offer. They're looking for people that love what they do and love to learn and grow on their own.

Basically, they came to my university and we had a phone interview. After that, they selected a group to fly up to redmond for the weekend and we had a full day of interviews. Each interview is with a different team that you can work with and all operate roughly independently (i.e. if you bomb one, you can still get in with a different team). After that, you wait for each team to decide whether they want you (they typically choose their top few candidates and then get the first one that isnt taken by another group).

First I submitted my resume to the recruiter. Then I was selected for a first interview round, with an engineer. I had to solve a programming exercise. I could chose the programming language. I was asked also several questions about my background. Then I was chosen for the final round. In this round I performed 4 interviews with different engineers from different deparments. In each interview I had to solve a programming task, on paper, or work through a testing and diagnostic scenario. Also I was asked questions about my interests, expertise and background. The programming tasks were about graphs, searching, string processing. In general the interviewers were nice and kind. At the end I was asked if I was willing to work in the Office team, but since I like software projects with hardware involved, I said it would be OK, but I'd rather be involved in the Xbox or Windows Phone teams.

The interview process consisted of a phone interview and a trip to Seattle for 4 FTF interviews. I was referred by a current intern and automatically was given a phone interview. The phone interview was scheduled for 45 minutes but it lasted for about an hour. The first 15-20 minutes consisted of behavioral questions such as Why Microsoft? and Tell me about a recent project? The next 20 minutes was spent discussing differences between different data structures, the order notation of different methods, and various questions about computer science topics. (Complexity of insertion into BST, array vs vector, what is a critical section?) The last 20 minutes I was given a coding problem to do on collabedit.

Three rounds of interviews, each with a pair of interviewers, one will focus on tech skills and one on soft skills. Each pair usually comes from a different team, and between rounds will advise each other on questions that were strong or weak from the candidate. If successful there is a fourth round of interviews with the local lead in the discipline for which you're applying (SDE or SDET.) If very unsuccessful, there won't even be three.

The process started at my university career fair where I gave out a resume. They gave me a t-shirt They got in touch a week later to schedule an on-campus interview at the university career services building. The interviewer asked one general thinking question (not coding) and one coding question. They also asked about my resume and research. Three or four weeks later I was contacted by an interview scheduler to setup an interview in Redmond. Due to the holiday season, I wasn't able to schedule the interview until a month later in January. The scheduler was not my recruiter and just was setting up the travel and timing. They flew me up and back and put me up in a hotel for 2 nights / 3 days. On their campus I first met with my recruiter in their recruiting building number 111. They informed me of which team I was interviewing with and stated that I should expect 4-5 hour long interviews (with one extended to 90 minutes to include lunch). In the recruiting building, while waiting to meet with a recruiter, you can play Xbox games, try out Windows Mobile products, and speak with a concierge who can help with sightseeing in Seattle or nightlight or transportation. The interviews were each with someone from a different sub-team inside the group I interviewed with. Each person had me do a coding question, and some also asked algorithmic or conceptual questions (which didn't require explicit coding). Everything was on the whiteboard. I had 5 total interviews, and had time in 4 of them to ask questions of the interviewer about their team. After the interviews I met with the recruiter again, and explained that I had immediate deadlines. They agreed to get in contact with the team and get back to me while I hung out in the lobby and relaxed. They came back and informed me that the team was very interested and would be making an offer. The offer arrived the next day, with fairly standard compensation and bonus/stock. I ended up declining the offer.

I applied online and got a call from one of their staff the next day to confirm my application and telling me about my first round. It was an online assessment on hackerrank site. There were 2 questions and 90 minutes to solve it. I attempted the interview on a Saturday and got a call on Monday that I am through the first round and asked me the schedule a date and time for a technical phone interview. The phone interview consisted of behavioral questions and basic OOPs principles. I was asked to choose a programming language to ask the questions and I choose Java. The questions were very basic like can more than one class exist in a .java file and if yes what are the conditions. The third round were three face to face one hour interviews with the engineers at their office. The mistake I did was I didn't brush up my database knowledge though I had it on my resume and the questions were from database and I didn't answer them well as they expected. So, I didn't clear the 3rd round but the fourth round was supposed to be a one full day assessment which was basically to know if I would suit their work culture.

Had an on campus interview with a Senior Engineer at Microsoft. I first asked to tell them about myself. Then, the interviewer asked some questions about my resume experience, including what my biggest challenges were and where I would go to find solutions to problems that came up during the development process. I was asked two technical questions. The first was to write a program to find the maximum height of a tree. The second was to write a program to print a tree in reverse order (i.e. the opposite of in-order traversal)

The reverse in-order traversal stumped me slightly; my solution was to do an in-order traversal, adding elements to a FIFO stack. Then after the traversal, pop off the elements of the stack.   1 Answer

It was a full-day process, I had one person responsible for me whom I'd meet in the morning, at lunch and for the final questions at the end of the day. The rest of the day was spent going from office to office, interviewing with (mostly) developers and project managers, spending an hour with each. The questions were predominantly technical, ranging from puzzlers to pieces of code the interviewer was currently working on.

I went through the college recruiting process. Microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where I signed up. The first round was on campus: lasted about 40 minutes, and was easy for a computer science major. About a week later, a recruiter emailed me to tell me that I was being invited for on-site interviews in Redmond (Seattle), WA. The recruiters are extremely fast and helpful in communicating; interestingly, Microsoft's recruiting process outdoes other companies (Google, FB etc) completely in efficiency and generosity. You're flown out to Redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget. Now, it's good to know how on-site interviews work: you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter, who you should befriend since they are "on your side", so to speak, and their input can matter in the decision process. Then, you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. You don't have to do perfectly in all of them, but I had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. The first one is particularly important. If you are doing well, you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. If you're lucky, you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes, like in my case, a really impressive big boss type person. This big boss can basically hire you on the spot, and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this. Don't forget that for Microsoft, as well as other companies, several things matter for college recruiting; your interviews, first and foremost, but also your coursework, projects, grades, internship experiences, etc. Also, knowing more math than average CS majors helps. The next day I found out that I was getting an offer, and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. Microsoft really, really wants smart new grads. The company and culture has REALLY been improving the past few years, and they want smart new grads to keep that up. Offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies. In my case, you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end, in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. In this case, you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general "hired" pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.

Microsoft's hiring is one of more organized of the pack. However, it definitely helps if your case is being pushed by the hiring manager, so if you can, do maintain contact with them. Interviews follow the typical structure for the industry: 1. Initial phone screen with the recruiter. 2. Phone Tech screen with a member of the engineering team. 3. Follow up call with recruiter to identify groups you'd be interested in. 4. On-site face-to-face interviews. Typically 4 (maybe 5 if you are doing a 'split' loop, or you're one of the more borderline cases) Overall, in onsite interview experience has improved dramatically over the years, for intervewees. Gone is the focus on brain teasers that left people numbed and shivering. Its more practical now. Which means - a more mixed bag of apples tends to get in, since its not just about how smart you are. I have mixed feelings about how this evolved.

The process was extremely well organized, requiring minimal effort for the interviewee. Flights were arranged as well as land travel to get to the hotel and interview location in Washington. For the actual interviews, four one-on-one interviews were held very early in the morning, since they needed to fit in two sessions in one day. My session went from 8am to 12pm, while the second session went from 1pm to 5pm. Each interview was a pretty standard technical interview that lasted 50 minutes. Questions were very technical and heavy on algorithms, but nothing out of the ordinary for software engineering interviews. The recruiters were very consistent in making you feel comfortable and answering any questions in between the interviews. They were clear and accurate about when results would be given for how the interviews went, which in my case was just two days.

I went to a career fair in the beginning of the fall semester talking to all the different Tech Companies who came and I went to Microsoft's table on a whim. I handed them my paper resume and didn't think anything about it being a sophomore not worrying too much about internship opportunities yet. At the end of December, I randomly received an email from a recruiter saying they wanted a phone interview with me. This took me off guard. I hadn't even applied online. I applied, did my phone interview where they asked me some brain teasers and low-level tech questions. Two days later my recruiter called me to tell me they wanted me to fly out to Seattle for an on-site interview! My interview was set for a month later and I flew out to have 5 one hour long interviews back to back. I really had a lot of fun with it. Although, it was extremely tiring. Then, Microsoft paid for us to explore Seattle and to get a feel for what the summer would be like if we got an offer.

There were two steps for the interview: first of all I got a phone screening check from HR, I was asked me about my professional background, my education, work and personal achievements. After that there was a phone test: small check on how to test a login form with two edit-boxess (login and password) and a submit button. The task was to create test cases and explain them, estimate coverage and create a test report. After I passed those two I got an on site interview invitation. In person interview was with three people one at a time: project development team lead and the head of engineering (site leader) and HR representative. I got a couple of simple questions from development team lead: reverse a string, reverse a linked list and find all elements from hash table with specific value. With site leader there were some questions about my knowledge of software development life cycle and agile development, after that we had an informal conversation on my personal views on software quality assurance, team work and overall personal goals.

Applied through University recruiting, there was a first technical question to write on paper and after that you got a call if you pass to the first round of interviews. The first round was with one employee from Redmond, first minutes was a little talk and introduction, after that a question related to Binary Trees, i managed to answer it correctly, after that he gave me another question related to the original problem and i made it good, then it was a little talk and some feedback from the interview which i think was a nice detail from the interviewer. After a few weeks I got an email from the recruiter, he told me that my interviewer recommended for the next round so a final round of interviews was scheduled next month. Honestly i studied very little, i reviewed some algorithms but the final round was totally different, there was three back to back interviews, all in the same format that the previous round, i think i made it good on the first two, however, the last one i didn't like the interviewer too much, he didn't speak too much and was always paying attention to his computer rather than the interview, after a week I recieved a rejection email. As a tip, read Program Interviews Exposed and Cracking the Interview code, also review algorithms and data structures, TALK ALOUD on the interview! this is very important!

Interview Round 1: Here I had to implement a sorted 2-D linked list (the first node of the linked list is connected to another linked list and it continues this way, and each row i.e. single linked list can have at most 5 nodes, and the keys stored in linked list are in sorted order). Along with representation write the add and delete function for this linked list. (Note: No pseudo code business there, had to write proper code). Finally he asked me how to test the code (basically wanted different test-cases to cover the whole code and its boundary cases). Interview Round 2: 1) In an image clouds are scattered all over. Lets say clouds are of white color and the rest of the image has different color. The problem was to count the number of such clouds. (Assume the image is given in a 2D matrix format). 2)Given an array find all the sub-arrays that has sum zero. (Note: an nlogn solution is required). A continuation of the above question was to find all subarrays with sum less than a small number lets say 1. Interview Round 3: In this round I was asked about my projects, BTP, interests and had to answer questions like – “why microsoft” or “what do you like about it” etc. After that he asked few aptitude-type questions, like- 1)Given two dice how would you represent all the days of a month? 2)How would you design an automated traffic-signal system? 3)What are the measures that you would devise to allow credit cards for children?

My interview began at 9am at the Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge, MA. I had three interviews scheduled before the lunch break and three interviews after. All the interviews were standard - straightforward whiteboard coding or brainteasers. Many of my interviews ran over time (one ran 45 mins over). I ended up not having time for lunch at all - my previous interview had run over and only half an hour of time had been scheduled, so I had 15 mins to purchase lunch in the lobby and run back upstairs to make the next interview. I would advise other candidates to bring their own lunches - the cafe was extremely crowded and it took me the entire 15 mins to get food and pay. I didn't have a complete schedule for the day, so I was unable to give the name of my next interviewer to the receptionist and ended up waiting in the lobby until my interviewer eventually came out to investigate. Since my interviews had run over time, my day was extended by an hour and I did the final coding interview after my meeting with the hiring manager (which was supposed to be the end of the day). I would encourage other candidates to brush up on their basic coding skills (string manipulation etc.) and brainteasers - the interviews were not design heavy. I would also encourage candidates to get a copy of their schedules in advance in case things go awry as security is very tight in the building. If I were to interview again, I would also bring snacks just in case.

I was asked some brainteasers taken nearly word-for-word from "How Would You Move Mount Fuji?" which I found surprising.   Answer Question

I applied through Microsoft's web-site, got a phone call telling me about the process. First interview- Technical: great atmosphere, after I introduced myself and heard about the position I was asked few questions: 1) find the first node where 2 linked lists are merging into O(n) (has no circles). answer: run 2 times on each list to find sizes, the bigger minus the smaller gives you the difference, on the longer list go the difference and then move them both in sync until they are equal. 2) print and transfer BST between 2 computers answer: use delimiter and print in order, read the file node then left child, every time you see delimiter go up 1 level print right child and then all of his left childs. 3) write code for ATM system, then what happens when you have 2 ATMs at the same time (sync with locks). second interview- Technical: again after I told about myself and heard more about the position, i was asked to go on the white board and design code for Domino game system. created the classes on board, main methods and was asked to actually implement few methods. Third interview- HR: Was very easy and ordinary, why you want to work for Microsoft, what are you looking for, what would your current manager tell about you and blah blah... Forth interview- AA interview: Failed here. it is the last step before you get a proposal. Again we started with me telling about myself, former projects I did in my current job (i couldn't tell much because of confidential information). we talked about a project I did during my degree. for unknown reason he started to ask me wired questions like how much memory is integer, i said (2^32-1) so he asked me how much is int[3000][3000] in memory. i wrote down the equation so he asked me to transfer it to MB's, and i didn't remember the exact numbers since i started to feel a bad feeling about this. then he asked me to give him a run time of merge sort (which i remembered is O(nlogn)) but he seems not to be thrilled about it. 4 days later i got a call that told me that i am not fit for this position, it really felt like it was personal, but there was not much that i could do about it.

how much memory is int[3000][3000] in bytes and then in MB's. should this size of memory be allocated or static?   1 Answer

I applied online. Got interview appointment in 3 weeks. I did interview over phone interview. First questions on your projects, then coding questions. The phone interview lasts for 30 minutes.

There were some basic data structure like implementing merge as in merge sort and reversing a string etc. One behavioral question on "why do you choose microsoft". Interviewers were very nice and good experience. was my very first tech interview.   Answer Question

Was contacted by phone and email 2 months after applying online and through campus recruiting. Phone interview consisted of fairly basic data structure questions involving stacks/queues and things like bucket sort. I was surprised by how tailored to my resume all of the other questions were, though. So make sure that you know everything you put on your resume well enough to speak strongly about. I made this mistake but it was apparently minor enough since I got invited for onsite interviews. Flew out to Seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. We stayed in the commons and hung out with a large (>40) group of other applicants for various positions--mostly SDE intern. It was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. The waiting room for all the interns was very nice. Large touchscreen TV for fruit ninja, another large surface table for other minigames, catered snacks and drinks. I was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. The Microsoft lunch area is very nice. We got a $10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. Everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way. Drinks were also free for all employees, which is cool. I was interviewing for a position in MSIT, which is Microsoft's internal tooling software teams. Things like the enterprise e-commerce division and others. Three technical interviews which were equal parts conversational and coding and one completely conversational job fit. Again my resume topics were discussed quite a bit more than I expected.  My interviewers were very interested in projects that I had worked on in groups and broad design choices we had made, so if you have any, be ready to speak to them. The interviews went well enough, though I think I choked in the last technical interview. They gradually make your solutions more and more difficult by adding restrictions like runtime and allowed data structures. It got to a point where I simply didn't have an answer, but that might be what they're looking for. 2 business days later, I got a call with an offer from my recruiter for an SDE position. A slightly lower base salary from the average, but I suspect they're including at least part of the -very- generous benefits package that Microsoft provides.

Lots of string manipulation and conceptual OOP questions. Wasn't expecting that based on the frequency of graph/tree questions that I felt was more the norm from other internship interview reviews.   Answer Question

This was through IJP from within MS itself being a MS employee. Really bad interview process in MS - GD. I had to push the HR to setup my interview as if I am the HR. Than again just 2 rounds in the whole day from morning 10 to evening 6 and I was told to leave without any feedback. Again I had to run behind the HR for getting the status update and finally after 10 days I was again called for an Hiring Manager round which went for 2 hours and that too instead of managerial question the HM round went into technical stuff. And as usual again I was asked to leave for the day and no update till 1 month even after running behind the HR a lot.

I applied through university career fair in mid-September and got the first-round interview in late-October. The interviewer asked me two questions. Both of them are not hard and I have seen both of them before. The first one is maximum subset sum and the second one is to write a program to transpose a matrix. I answered them correctly and quickly. The interviewer then asked me if I have seen similar problems before because he thought I answered them "Too quickly and correctly". I didn't want to lie to him so I told the truth that I really saw them before. He said nothing. A few days later, I received an email saying I performed excellently in the interview but the quota of internship for my university is full. I am not sure if Microsoft is only comforting me or he really thinks highly of me. But the fact is, I was rejected.

I visited their booth at my University's career fair and then got an on-campus interview about 1 and a half months later. The on-campus interview was a short 30 minute interview where I got asked questions about linked lists: How would you determine if there is a cycle in a linked list? How would you find the head of the cycle i.e. where the cycle starts? How would you find the kth element from the end of a linked list? Then about 2 weeks later I got an invitation for interviews on-site and about 3 weeks after that I flew out to Redmond. I had 4 interviews on-site which had behavioral questions and also coding questions like: How would you test a phone (your simple 20 year old phone)? Give test cases for some functions whose implementation is not know i.e. blackbox testing. The people there were great and I really liked their campus.

I handed my resume to an on-campus recruiter. A few days later, I got an email asking me to sign up for an interview slot on campus. I had an interview a few weeks later with a PM from the Mountain View campus. She recommended me for a SDE internship, and about 2 weeks after that interview I was notified that I would be flown to Redmond for final rounds. They changed the location to Mountain View, CA a few weeks later. I flew over, stayed over two nights, and on the second day, had my interview. There were four rounds, based in C++ (my most familiar language was Java). The last round was with a high-up manager who talked about Microsoft's goals and future direction. I heard less than 24 hours after my last interview through email that I got a position as a summer intern. Whole process was ~2 months because of my busy finals period and trying to schedule a time to fly over to California.

I first applied through college job fair then was interviewed on campus couple weeks later where I was asked two questions one about writing an algorithm to count the height of a binary tree and the other about making an algorithm that spits out the binary of a given number. Then I was interviewed in Redmond about a month later where I was interviewed by four different people each one asked me a technical questions that wasn't that bad. Read the next section for the questions.

Four technical questions: 1) Given an MxM array make it rotate in a certain way. The rotation was a little complicated and I couldn't answer this question very well. The interviewer did not do a very good job explaining it.   Answer Question 2) Write a new version of strcpy where it will return the null terminator no matter what. Did a better job on this one the guy said he was evaluating for correctness not only for idea.   Answer Question 3) Given a string with many words make a function that would reverse all of the letters in every word. For this one I first wrote a crappy algorithm that takes O(n^2) but then I did a better one that worked in linear time.   Answer Question 4) This guy was more complicated he first asked me different questions about object oriented programming. I did not know what a virtual class was. He then asked me to do some string manipulation and kept making the problem harder until we ran out of time. The problem he started off with was write an algorithm that counts how many repeated letters are in a string and kept going from there. -- There was very few behavioral questions about my favorite projects.   Answer Question

This is for a SDE internship. My relationship with Microsoft began when a friend of mine invited me to a dinner with some Microsoft employees who were visiting my university's campus. I later spoke with them and gave them my resume at my school's career fair, and was offered an on-site interview. It lasted thirty minutes and was very enjoyable; I was asked to do a string operation and design a certain object from an OOP perspective. Easy enough, and I had a lot of fun talking with the interviewer about Microsoft and my projects/interests. A few weeks later, I got an invitation to fly out to Redmond to interview on-site for the Operating Systems Group. Microsoft paid for all of my expenses, and I stayed in the very pleasant Marriott Hotel. I arrived on campus at about 8:30 AM and my first interview was at 10. I spoke with the other interns and some of the staff before my first interview, all were friendly. I had a total of four interviews, one of which was over lunch (the food at their cafeterias is excellent, by the way). All were a lot of fun, and my interviewers chose good questions - ones that could be looked at in many ways, answered in many ways, and expanded on. This made our discussions very interesting. I was extremely tired by the fourth interview, as I had only just arrived at my hotel at midnight the previous night. I got back to the hotel at around 3, and took a nap. My flight didn't leave till close to midnight, so it was a long night getting home... But worth it - I received an offer a week later.

The onsite interview was amazing, you first get there and sit in the main lobby for about an hour. Here they want you to play with some of the stuff such as playing video games on their xbox one. They give you free coffee and drinks while you wait. They do this to help your relax. After this you talk to a recruiter for a while and he explains what team you'll be interviewing for and how each interview will happen. The interviews were pretty nice, they were semi-difficult questions. Most of them were based on strings with a couple of graph theory questions. Some of the questions are based on your resume experience. If you get walked out after lunch the process is over, at the last interview you'll talk to your future potential manager.

Suppose you have a string which has characters that are either one or two bytes long. A one byte character has 0 as the left most bit. The first byte of a two byte character has 1 as the left most bit but the second byte's left most bit (LMB) could be either 1 or 0. Implement an algorithm for removing 1 character from the end of the string. How would you do it while scanning backwards from the end of the string. Followup: What if you needed to do this repeatedly? Is there some way you could reduce the time complexity to constant?   1 Answer

I am a mechanical engineer by training with past programming experience for primarily personal projects (video games and such) in multiple languages. I'm currently in a PhD program finishing up the masters portion. I casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there "may" be something for me at Microsoft but he doesn't know what. He told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. They called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after. I'm not - what I like to call - "classically trained" when it comes to computer science. I prepared for the screening interview by going through the MIT OCW Algorithms and Data Structures course and also reading Miller and Ranum's "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures." The screening interview went better than expected. Among other things, I was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes. A few weeks later I got a call for a final round interview. It took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so I requested a later date. The scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. They flew me to Redmond for an interview with the Bing team (I wasn't given that information until the morning of the interview). I was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. My first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. Everything after that went smoothly. I got through all 5 interviews. The third interview was over lunch (we wrote code after, not during). The fifth interview was with a program manager. The questions seemed relatively easy. The topics were: queue design, common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure, mixed uni and multi byte character strings, detection of unique addresses, and linked list scanning and element removal. Some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as I could. Others were looking for a discussion of the problem (one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas). At the very end I asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition I was facing. It's nice to be told that there is a "high probability" of them making an offer :)

This interview process was at Mexico, applying for an SDE position at Redmond. I went to a college recruiting and a screening technical problem was applied. Once I finished, they asked me to explain the solution and any test cases I would apply. They set me up for an interview in-campus. The interview consisted of asking me about personal and school projects, and any prior experience that may show passion for technology. Two technical questions were asked (receive two strings and print unique characters in order, implement atoi). At the end the interviewer told me to wait up to 3 weeks. I got contacted about a week later, setting up details for an interview at Mexico City. They told me I would be interviewing with 3 to 4 persons. The interview was about a month later. Microsoft paid for my travel expenses to Mexico City. There, I had 3 interviews, each with a different team. I was told I would not be interviewing for a particular team or position, but being interviewed by different teams gave them a good insight. Each interview is about 45-50 minutes 1. The first interviewer gave a few minutes to ask about previous projects. He told me he was in the Embedded Windows team. He then asked 2 technical questions (telephone keypad and angle between minute and hour hand in a clock), and a brain teaser. He seemed interested in knowing my thinking process, rather than the actual solution. 2. The second interviewer first focused more on behavioral questions and some past experience. He told me he was in the Operating Systems group, focused in security. He seemed as if it was an interview recipe for him, as he would not allow to talk about anything else. The questions were the next: - What has been the most challenging technical issue you have faced? - Tell me about a Microsoft product you like. Why? How has it been useful to you? - Tell me about a Microsoft product you don't like. Why? What would you have done differently, if you were part of the dev team for that product? Then he asked two technical questions (show odd numbers from 1 to N, function that swaps variables). This interviewer did not allow any question during the technical question. He was definitely not interested and what I thought while solving the problem, and did not want other solutions but his. H 3. My third interview was the longest, as we had a long conversation. He was in the Windows Update team, in charge of reviewing and fixing upon feedback provided, and deployment. He first asked my most challenging technical issue, as my answer was similar to the first one he asked me about another one. Interviewers share notes between them, so they don't ask you the same stuff. He also asked me what had I accomplished at my job that I was proud of. After some chit-chat on SQL and databases, he asked a technical question (Fibonacci with index).

Applied through campus job fair, heard back in around 2 months for an on-campus interview. The interview was supposed to be 30 minutes long, however mine ran around 20 minutes overtime. The actual interview was described as a mix between behavioral and technical questions, but the interviewer just asked about projects on my resume and 1 technical question. Interviewer was friendly and approachable.

I applied the Software Development Engineer Intern 2015 Summer in our University Career Site before the recruiters came to our school on the career fair. After about one month, I got email from their recruiter saying that they would like to set up an in-person interview at school. I selected the best time fit me. There are three sections in the first round interview. The first is talking about myself and my projects listed on my resume. Then I had a coding problem about basic algorithm on paper. The last section is asking questions about Microsoft. The interview process was pretty standard, and the whole interview last about 45 minutes.

The most difficult question, I would say, was the explanation of one technology that I listed on my resume, but I was not well-prepared for.   1 Answer

I talked to a recruiter at a career fair and submitted my resume online, and got contacted a month later. There was a preliminary interview with a standard coding question, and after that, I got invited to a day of interviews at Microsoft (Cambridge headquarters). There were 4 interviews, 45 minutes each. Two were coding challenges and two asked about my projects and what I liked most in CS/what I would like to work on. They got back to me within 5 days with an offer.

Submitted my resume both online and to the college recruiter, and had an initial on-campus interview one month later. The interview is only 30 minutes long. The interviewer first asked about my resume and we had time for only one technical question. I gave a search algorithm and he asked me to improve the runtime. Finally he let me ask him questions about the job.

Given a method that takes in a string of letters and returns if it is a valid word, how do you solve the problem of word segmentation? In other words, given a string of letters (a-z only) and return a valid break down of the string into an array of words. There are be multiple different valid answers, and your solution need only return one of them. Example: segment("hellohowareyou") returns ["hello", "how", "are", "you]   1 Answer

I uploaded a resume to their site and after about 2-3 weeks an e-mail came for a 30-minute phone interview. The interview took place a week after and I was asked most personal questions, i.e. when I am about to graduate, what places would I prefer to work in Microsoft, hom many lines of code is the biggest program I have written and in which language. He also asked me how I handled a situation where my colleagues couldn't help me with a project and I had to work on my own, which project was most difficult to implement and why, what I think good code is and great code is and their differences. Finally, he asked me a puzzle where there are 3 baskets, one with oranges, one with apples and one with oranges and apples. The 3 baskets have labels (oranges, apples, oranges + apples) but they are in the wrong place. If you can take only one fruit from only one basket would you be able to understand which basket contains what. After that he told me that an e-mail will inform me in about 3-5 weeks if I get to the next round. I am still waiting.

I wasn't asked any technical questions, which was a bit unexpected.   Answer Question

First there was a Skype interview with questions about what have you worked on before and some about testing, for example how would you test a pencil. After that they invite you to interview and pay you the trip. There are 3-4 interviews. You can get an offer after 3 and after 4, or you can get rejected after 3 and after 4. 4th interview is just if they think they need one more interview to make a decision. Interviews last for 45min and have around 10min break in between. The questions depends on who interviews you, but in general almost all of them ask how would you test something. The algorithmic questions are some basic algorithms. You can of course use any programming language, but the ones with object oriented paradigm are recommended. The correct names of the methods and parameters are not that important.

I was expecting hard questions, but the questions were simple basic algorithm and data structures.   Answer Question

Got contacted by an outside recruiter for a phone screening. Then they offered to fly to an external hiring event. Had standard 4 (or 5) technical interviews + one behavioral with the hiring manager. Got an offer a couple of weeks after that. Relocation and other parts of the transition went smoothly, the team(s) responsible for that know perfectly what they are doing.

Can't remember the actual questions now, but those were usual interview ones. No crazy trees or graphs, but mostly combinatorics-like, string/array manipulation, basic geometrical applications etc. No brain teasers, only technical.   Answer Question

I applied last October, had an on-campus interview a couple weeks later, then they flew me up to Seattle beginning of January. I was surprised how long the interview process took. The first interview was short, 30-45 minutes. The final round of interviews took most of the day. There were 3 interviews(however the number can range from 2-5 depending on who scheduled them for you), each lasting maybe an hour, maybe more. They told me the following week that I didn't get the job. The questions ranged from difficult to easy. It never felt like a grueling test, it felt more like a conversation about algorithms. Unfortunately, on the harder questions, I was the person who didn't know the topic too well.

Began and ended with small talk regarding myself, the interviewer and Microsoft in general. Was not asked any data structure/algorithm questions which was surprising to me. The only technical question asked was regarding string manipulation within a function.

It started out with me reaching out to a recruiter through Linkedin. I was then told if a hiring manager is interested in my resume, I would be contacted shortly. I heard back next week and was then set up for a Skype Interview. This interview lasted for a hour and questions were pretty straightforward (One coding question and one testing/design related question). In the next week after the Skype interview, I was contacted once again and invited onsite for 4 interviews. Interview 1: Lunch interview which included knowing more about the team and what they are working on. After the lunch, we went back to the office and there was whiteboard coding questions. This round lasted for about 90 minutes. Interview 2: The interview started with me describing (Sequence Diagram) of my current project. After that I was asked a coding problem and was asked to determine the test cases. This interview lasted for about 60 minutes. Interview 3: A purely testing question followed by some whiteboard coding. This interview too lasted for about 60 minutes. After this interview, the interview told me that my next round of interview would be with the Hiring Manager. Interview 4: Purely behavioral and the hiring manager sees if you are a good fit for the team. Heard back in a week and was extended an offer. Tips: Don't be scared. I was a little overwhelmed when I walked through the campus but then the HR along with other interviewers really ease you into the interview. Talk loudly as the interviewer then knows what you are thinking about. I was given few hints when I was stuck and the hints really help in that case. Also I was really comfortable writing code on the whiteboard as I spent 2 weeks before the onsite interview practicing on the whiteboard. This really helps. A must do! Approach the testing questions in a very structured manner as they really like that. Cracking the coding interview has those steps mentioned. Resources: Geeksforgeeks - This is the only online resource that I referred as I had gone through Cracking the coding interview and Programming interviews exposed in the past.

I applied through campus recruiting. In campus they asked a question about how to convert a double number into a String, 2 weeks later I received an invitation for the second round in Guanajuato, Guanajuato. In this round I was asked how to get the maximum and minimum of an IPv4 address, I believe i answered correctly but I might have skipped a few details (on late sept). The week after that I received an email telling me to wait for results with a message saying that they were not sure about these results and that the recruiter would have a meeting with my interviewer to decide wether to keep me or not (last time I applied I received one saying that they were soon to reach its peak recruiting volume, which makes me think they still interview people in other regions of LATAM and make you wait until they have "x" number of "good" candidates to which they do a "SELECT TOP 30 * order by "unkown parameters"), it also said that final results would be ready by Oct 24, I didn't receive any notice from them until I asked after such date, they decided to end the interviews for that year, even though the recruiter was a very nice person, I didn't like the fact that they forgot to notify me.

THIS IS FOR THE SUMMER INTERNSHIP The preliminary round was held online in select colleges and we were called for an onsite interview. Those with good thinking approach were also chosen and not solely based on getting the solution. There was also a coding round for those with lesser score in the online round. A simple problem was given to many students and we were expected to solve it. If the approach was deeply flawed, the person would be eliminated. The next round was a technical round where a 1-1 interview with a Microsoft employee was held. The duration was about an hour and was quite strenuous. Following the round, the HR manager will let you know the feedback and tell you the results. The HR manager was very encouraging and asked the eliminated candidates to reapply after working their skills. This feedback really made a very positive impact on me. The final round would be a HR round I guess(I could not crack the technical round).

Meet with a recruiter at a campus career fair and scheduled an on-campus screen two days later. This was followed up within less than a week for final-round interviews at a regional interviewing event. The process was quick. The interviewers were flown in to a regional office instead of flying us out to Seattle; I believe this was because I've already visited their offices earlier in the year. So instead of meeting each interviewer in their office, all the interviewees were based in the same room with the recruiter while the interviewers came in to get each of us for a 1:1 in a private room.

The whole process took about a month though the career network of my university. Microsoft sent a campus recruiter to give a talk about their programs. Soon after, I have a on campus screening interview lasting 30 minutes x 2. A set of technical and behavioral interview. After that, I was sent relevant information with regards to the final interview fairly early. Approximately a month later, I was at Microsoft Singapore for a full day of interviews. There were 4 interviews in total, all interviews have their coding component. 15 minute breaks were dividing each interview and information about Microsoft were further discussed. No lunch interview was held.

I applied on the college job board and got an email from the recruiter a couple days later for some positions and signed up for an interview time for the next week. Got to the on-campus interview and talked a bit about my prior experience and internships, why Microsoft, and then what I wanted to do to change the world. Half-way through the 30 minute interview the interviewer asked me a coding question that I promptly failed after writing meaningless loops for a recursion problem. Overall I felt like I had a tough interview question and a tough/apathetic interviewer. He started checking his phone once I started writing on the whiteboard and clearly seemed more focused on getting the interviews done on time so he wouldn't be late for the next ones.

Hiring through career fair at top-tier school. Skype interview first and then on-site at Redmond. Skype interview was for PM position and was pretty straight forward. 2 weeks later got contacted for final round. A couple of days later my application was changed from PM to SDET. Even though I didn't want that position, I decided to go and find out more about Microsoft. Final rounds was 3 interviews (1 SDE, 1 SDET, 1 PM) and lunch.

I applied online in August and got an phone interview. We talked about my past experience and I was given a simple brain teaser and a design question. Mostly focused on my work/project experience. Waited 4~5 weeks and then they told me they want to fly me out to Redmond to do onsite interviews. Travel + hotel all booked by their travel team. I was attending a conference in a different city the week before my interview but it was no problem for them to adjust my flight for my convenience. Everything was really nice, they do really take care of their employees and potential ones as well. On the interview day, I woke up around 6 and went out to the lobby of the hotel around 6:45 am , there were other people who are also waiting to get picked up by Microsoft. We arrived at the building where interviews are held. Breakfast at 7:30, mingle with other interviewees, and then interview started at 8. Each 45 minutes long with 15 min breaks in between. Lunch at noon, we all headed to the "Commons" (or whatever they call it) it's the main area of the campus. Where we ate was giant food court style, all sorts of food available. etc. After lunch, we headed back to the interview building and they told us some logistics of what's next. 1.5 days later, I got an email asking when I'll be available to "chat" and the next day, my recruiter called and said I got the position. One thing I want to say is that, Redmond + Bellevue is dominated by Microsoft buildings and it seems that you get a lot of respect if you are an Microsoft employee. They even have a "Microsoft employee only" counter at the Seattle airport. Blew my mind... Also, these cities or towns....they are brand new and also their environment is really nice, trees and mountains everywhere with fresh air and etc.

NDA, but nothing difficult. get ready to talk about every past work experience/projects. They are looking to hire someone innovative and a team player. I didn't get any questions related to any Microsoft products which was surprising. The company is going through a lot of changes (for good I believe) and just show them your logic solving questions...mostly importantly, have fun doing it, get to know the interviewers.   Answer Question

Second stage was conducted in Seattle, four interviews all 1:1 with breaks in between. Some asked coding questions, other more conceptual problem solving questions but usually relating to job-related tasks.

I was given a Binary Search Tree problem, where you were to search the tree and determine if it was indeed a Binary search tree.

I heard back around 3 weeks later, mainly b/c I had a offer that was on the verge of expiring. They flew me out to the Redmond campus that same week. The day of the interview, I arrived on site around 8am and had a quick chat with HR. They told me which team I was interviewing for and sent me to the building for the interviews. I had 5 interviews and 1 lunch interview. This lasted until around 3PM. I received a call the next day and was extended an offer. The technical questions asked: On-campus interview:     remove duplicates from an unsorted array On-site interviews:     implement strtok     reverse string(ie. hello world => world hello)     find lca for bst     find first non repeating character in string     given a list of characters and the function toLower, implement toUpper     check for palindrome in string and singly linked list     check if binary tree is bst

To be hired Microsoft has two stages. Initially you will be provided with a phone interview (30 mins) or On-Campus interview. You may be asked a technical question. Be prepared to answer questions related to your background/projects. I passed this stage and in about a week I was notified that I will be moving on to their on-site interview in Redmond. I was given about a months time between the phone interview and my on-site. Depending on your process, you will either be going to Microsoft Building 111's recruitment event where you are cycled through 4 interviewers between you and 10 - 20 other candidates, or meeting with a recruiter and then going to another building to interview where you will have 3 - 5 interviews, including a lunch interview. This time I was selected to interview with 3 - 5 people in the Office team. You are not given your team beforehand. The team you are interviewing with may also not be the team you end up working with. The problems are algorithmic in nature and you are expected to test and clarify requirements. Each interview is about an hour long and between each interview you will be taking a break while the interviews discuss among each other about how you did. From what I have understood each interviewer has a hire/no hire decision. If you receive 2 no hires out of your first 3 interviews, your day may be cut short. When you reach the 5th interview, (s)he is the hiring manager and ultimately has veto power. For me it was a rather discouraging experience. I made it to the 5th interview. I felt I performed very well, giving them optimal solutions, and struggling with only 1 and a half of the 6 problems I was asked, but ended up solving them optimally in the end. However, I received the discouraging call later that week that I would not be hired. It didn't make sense to me and I tried to reflect on how I could have done poorly being very familiar with technical interviews at this stage. I felt that what I had to nitpick with myself what I performed weakly on. The most discouraging part is how they will not tell you anything aside from apply back next year. At this stage I'm not even sure how to improve since I do not think I am technically lacking and I did not believe I came off rude or obnoxious during the interview. Just my luck.

Swap a doubly linked list in pairs. (This was the problem that I struggled with most and happened to be the first of the two during the last interview - I over thinked it because I had visited a problem the evening before of swapping singly linked list in pairs and had ruined my thought process)   Answer Question

This is a the first round on campus interview. I was selected as one of the 12 interviewees that gets the opportunity. The recruiter comes from HQ in Seattle, and he joked that he still feel the jet leg. The recruiter is a serious guy but very professional in recruiting. I like the way he goes straight into point and asks me about my background, the language that I am comfortable with - C++, Java. The first technique question is about the similarity and difference between C++ and Java. Then he asks me to calculate the factorial of an array of integers. I think I did not that bad on this one, because everybody knows how to calculate the factorial of an integer. After finishing with the code, he wants me to tell him the pro and cons that I choose this recursion algorithm. I talked about he efficiency of writing and understanding in the format of recursion, and the con is algorithm complexity. He then asked me how to improve the algorithm, I did not come up with a good alternative algorithm, so I told him I can implement the recursion in a distributed fashion. The pro is scalability, and the con is extra cost on machines. At last, he ask me to say something about testing - how to possibly test the class I just wrote. I think I did well in this one - you just need to say how you generate the input and how to compare the experimental output to the known output.

The hiring process is a stepped approach, unlike other tech companies like Google and Amazon that use a committee approach. In the stepped approach, a no-hire vote from an interviewer will likely terminate the process immediately. In the committee approach, no interviewer is given the result of any other interviewer until the process is complete or partially complete. With the stepped approach, obviously if your interviews are three or less, you are almost certainly without an offer. If you have the lunch interview and beyond, you are looking good. In general, it's a day-long process ending with the final interview with someone higher up on the management chain, usually senior level or higher. For technical interviews, know the data structure, algorithms (including big O notation), object-oriented programming basics-to-advanced (depending on the position you are looking for), and testing methodologies. You should be well-versed and proficient in the programming languages you have delineated on your resume. For other questions, study the standards (i.e., What is the best experience you have had as a programmer, the worst, why did you leave your last position, etc, etc). Also, some interviewers still like to use riddles and brain teasers so brushing up on those would be a good idea.

Contacted by a MS recruiter on LinkedIn. Got first screen check call by recruiter in 2 weeks and expressed my interest in Dev Lead position. Took a month to receive phone interview. The interviewer was late for half an hour so was rushed. Nice guy, simple questions for half an hour, used an online tool to test my coding for a simple problem: Swap two by two items in a linked list. Got approval email for on-site interview the day after. Took another 3 weeks to attend on-site interview in Vancouver office. Very early interview starting at 7:30 AM !!! with introduction and then 8 AM first interview. Interviewer was a Software Manager, asked about my background and current company and role. Then a question for a Data Structure for keeping large amount of integers and have Insert, Delete and Median functions with best possible performances. Answered the question with pros and cons for each data structure. Had problem to find the best logic for median. Gave me a clue and could answer the question before end of interview. Second interview did it great like 95% correct, a dev lead same intro question then 2 coding questions answered both perfectly with no help, maybe 1-2 small mistakes for boundary check which I found it easily in review. Finished the interview 5 min earlier even so he said let me ask some web questions now that we have 5 mins left, answered all except one. After second interview the recruiter came to my room and said that the team does not want to interview me more!!! I got shocked! Bad sign since I've read before that if you don't have the 3rd or 4th interview you have not made it likely. I said I applied for a Dev Lead position, but no leadership or management questions yet. Got very much disappointed after 2 weeks of preparation and studying over 500 interviews. I'm very sorry for my interviewers if they really think with that performance and Resume and without asking any leadership or management questions, their time is not worthy to spend more than 2 interviews with me. Got very very DISAPPOINTED because I spent days and hours to prepare for them but they simply ignore me. I think it was not my lucky day. You need to have luck as well as perfect preparation and knowledge to make it through.

The recruiter had a quick chat with me before arranging for a technical interview for evaluating my problem solving/algorithms/programming skills. The technical interview was conducted over phone and collabedit. I was given a programming problem (to be solved in the language of my choice). I used JavaScript to write the solution. The interviewer pointed out the need for optimization and gave some hints. I quickly figured out a fairly optimized code. The interviewer didn't sound too impressed with my performance. As the problem was fairly simple, he probably expected me to write a perfectly optimized code on the first shot. In my opinion, I exhibited the ability to discuss and think through solutions, rather than being well-versed in solving a certain class of problems. There is no telling what works.

Nothing unexpected or particularly difficult. What is really hard is that the transparency is one way. You give your answers and you will never get to know what the interviewer was expecting to hear.   Answer Question

Very fast process for me, but have heard that it went slow for some others. So varies. Got a phone screen with some technical questions, then an onsite within a few days, and an offer a few days after that. The interviews were good, lots of whiteboard coding questions but good questions, nothing stupid. Some basic sanity checks, i.e. very simple questions, some slightly more complicated (e.g. rearranging linked lists). Long day. If one or two interviewers give a solid thumbs down they often stop the process so they do not waste time, so if the interview is shorter than expected then expect bad news. If you make it to see the hiring manager it is a good sign.

Honestly don't remember, but I was not stuck anywhere so there was nothing too ridiculous. But they do expect you to think of edge cases and test cases, especially for an SDET.   Answer Question

I was contacted by a recruiter from Microsoft, who found my profile on LinkedIn. He sent me an online test for me to take, which I passed. Then his colleagues scheduled the on-site interview in Redmond, Washington. The interviews went well. I had a good rapport with the four interviewers. Each interview consisted of a few minutes of information questions, followed by a coding question that you have to do on a whiteboard. I answered all but one of the coding questions correctly, as far as I could tell. No matter how much you prepare, a lot of it comes down to luck -- you never know how much a question can stump you, even if the interviewer is helping you. I did study and practice some questions before the interview, but I can't say that it really made much difference.

My fifth interview was with hiring manager (a Test manager), he also sent me to board for another whiteboard session, then asked me various test questions, like give test cases for testing the keyboard, coffee mug, MS Paint, then he started over resume and asked me questions on my research assistantship experience and projects that I completed there.

I wen through the full interview process, from recruiter screen up to the full day in person interviews in Bellevue (the position was for the Dynamics AX platform). My initial technical screen was pretty standard, the question was determining if two strings were anagrams of each other. Aside from this I was able to speak with the senior engineer who was interviewing my about the position and some pro's and con's which was really great. He provided some good insight for me. After the technical screen I was invited in for full day of interviews in Bellevue. I flew out to Seattle and stayed for 2 nights. The entire travel process was great, they covered everything and put me up in a nice hotel. The interview day was long, I had a series of interviews each testing different areas. All of the interviews were with senior engineers with 5 - 20 years experience. The first interview covered SQL, I was given a schema and asked to point out any issues/improvements and then write some queries. The next 2 covered CS based questions like algorithms, runtime analysis .. etc. Next I had a lunch interview where I was able to talk with another engineer about his role and get a little more of a sense of the day to day life. Finally I had one more algorithms based interview and that was the end. Overall I found that the interview process was very well done and the hr staff at Microsoft were really easy to deal with. When it comes to the atmosphere at Microsoft it has a really corporate feel to it and truthfully it was not my top choice having been there but that's more of a personal preference.

I was being interviewed for a summer internship with this title, they flew me up to Washington for an in-person group interview after a screening interview at my college (which I got through handing a resume to a recruiter through the career fair). This screening interview was fairly simple, one technical question, some questions about what I'd like to work on, etc. Everything is paid for when you're up their, car, hotel, and food. In person interview was a 5 rounds that either lasted throughout the morning or afternoon (there were two groups of interviewees from colleges across the country) and you spend about an hour with each person, and by the end they tell you on the spot if you've passed or failed. Each interview asks some type of technical question where you solve an algorithm, everyone asks for a self evaluation on how you think you're doing at this stage in the interview. Office where I interviewed was fairly interesting, one section had meeting rooms that all referenced video games from Halo to Half Life, there was also one of those Microsoft tablet tables with games on it, as well as an Xbox 360 running Halo. They serve some food, but it's not worth remembering, and there's breaks in-between interviews where they very much discourage you from discussing any of the questions being asked.

Nothing too difficult about the technical questions, I came from a public school in CA near the start of my JR year, and by the end of the year every type of question that was asked was covered in class. They don't look for the absolute best answer, as long as it's not overly complicated.   Answer Question

I was very impressed with the efficiency of the hiring process. After submitting my resume on Microsoft.com/jobs, I did not hear from the team I applied to. But within a week, I was contacted by a different team about a job that was a better fit. There was a technical phone screen which included homework to write code and email it in. Then I was invited to fly to Redmond for an interview. I met with six interviewers in one day, which included my manager, a couple peers, and a direct report. It was a grueling day, but there were no big surprises or questions I was not prepared for. During the interviews, it became clear to both me and to the interviewers that I was qualified for more than the position they were hiring for. They had the flexibility to change the scope of the job (and the level) to better fit my qualifications. The whole process - from first visiting the web site to getting an offer took about a month.

There was a detailed technical question about a test strategy for a complex system built with a domain-specific language. When I answered in general terms, the interviewer kept pressing for more specifics and detailed examples. I finally realized that she didn't really understand the problem. I confronted her with "This is your job, isn't it? And you don't know how to do it!" She admitted I was right.   Answer Question

4 interviews on same day we can write logic in any programming language, but writing on paper or white board is required (no computer) there is a no single correct answer, just if you are giving a solution or not, and if you are improving it or not is the thing which is seen. 1st interview - general programming questions - single tech interviewer, asked about 10-15 questions oops concepts, c++, small programmings questions, and question on how to store many data types in 1 type (in c# there is a type called object which is base for all data types/classes) 2nd interview - senior programmer - answer was required to be written on white board, it was very difficult, but he dint care about the syntax, but he just cared about the logic, gave a solution, improved it, in the end he asked what did u learn from this interview outcome? i said, may be i can come to the optimal solution directly if i take a little more time. 3rd question - management - very cool guy - just 2 to 3 questions, very logical ones, question was 2 people are circling a very large circle, when will they meet? i failed to answer this, but he felt i was ok which is correct, the problem here is i assumed they both were circling at a constant speed so they wudnt meet, for example, if they were at different speed (one is faster) then at some point in time they wud meet, so simple, the speed = distance / time like formula will tell when they will meet assuming circle is of some circumference (distance here) u will get the time since u can assume some different speed & same distance for both. i think thats it passed, worked for about 3+years.

Initial Call: I was referred to a (techincal) manager internally who contacted me directly. After a a casual chat he sussed out that I would need to brush up on data structure / algorithms and would call me back in 2 weeks. I picked up my algo/datastructures textbook and read through it and worked through writing simple algorithms on paper during my commute. Official Screener: During my official technical screening (figuring out whether they'll fly you out to redmond or not) they asked me the standard linked list question - detect if there's a loop, etc. and then asked me to create a system to organize a bunch of objects with different classifications. I ended up coming up with a dewey decimal system. I was also asked finding the common ancestor in a binary trees. On Campus: I got setup with somebody from HR as my first interview. I was told I could ask her anything to help me through my interview process. I asked her some random questions like " should i not mention that my last project was using google apis". To which she replied that Microsoft respects any good technology so just because they're competing, don't be afraid to talk about it. Tech Interviews: 1. Write a function to list all prime numbers up to a maximum. Finished it in 15 minutes and then was asked to write test cases for it. I filled up one whiteboard. 2. Non-coding - was asked to test a webpage with a single inputbox and a button. 3. Remove a character from a string. Test it. 4. Walk a binary tree, breadth first. Test it. (I ran out of time with this one) 5. My as-appropriate asked me a technical question because i didn't do so well on my last question. He asked to merge two link lists. I answered it with no troubles.

I attended a conference and noted down the presenter's email id as I was really impressed with the work they were doing. When looking for full time, I contacted the person for any openings in their team. Fortunately, I heard back from them and got a phone screen schedule within one week. Phone Screen was easy and mainly focused on the projects i wrote in my resume and some algorithmic problems related with those projects. Within one week, I heard back from them that I was through first round and need to come to Seattle for face to face interview. They were really helpful in scheduling the interview according to my convenience. Microsoft takes care of their their employees and potential employees as well in my case. Wonderful and systematic scheduling. I landed in Seattle. Whole day was set aside for interviews, I had 5 in total including the famous 5th interview which is a positive sign as mentioned by many here. First interview, little variation on the level order traversal which i was able to code it with some help from the recruiter who was really nice. You will have to write the code on board so I would suggest do some "Actual" coding preferably on some IDE which shows only syntactical errors and runs the program. Eclipse is sometimes too helpful which let's us forget minor mistakes. Second round was a real life project problem related with quick ip lookup, for which I have default solution, Tries. I told each and every pros and cons of using tries and the interviewer was satisfied. I stumbled a little while implementing it but eventually was able to do that with of course the help of interviewer. Oh yeah one more thing each interview is approximately 45 mins to 60 mins long and lunch time discussion is also part of the recruiting process. So don't lose your head thinking that it's not part of the process. 3rd interview which included the lunch discussion as i mentioned above. I was not aware of it but since interviewer only discussed my projects on resume, i was happy to talk about them. But was really thinking why the lunch is so much work. Later i realised when interviewer said, let's go back to the office and continue the discussion. This was the toughest round as interviewer went in to very specific details about my projects so one tip do remember some of the tools names, just to name drop them ;) 4th round was a short one as the 3rd one went for one and half hours. This one was comparatively lighter and mainly focused on design problems. Then came, the nerve wrecking wait as they told me to wait so that they all can discuss how i performed and decide on the last interview with the 2nd line manager. Thankfully manager came soon and ask me to wait for 2nd line manager. That discussion was very informal sort as he was selling me Microsoft and why I should come and work there. Happy sign always ! :) Then I came back to my awesome hotel as I had my flight back same day in the evening. Almost next day itself the HR contacted me and I missed her call. I really thought I did'nt get through but thankfully Hr called me back next day and told me I am through !! Only advice I can give you is "CODE" ! there is no way around it! If you want to work as SDE you need to know Algorithms and Data Structures ! Language is no issue but you must know how to implement it. At least able to discuss why to us and why not to use a particular data structure.

After sending an email to the HR manager I received a screening form with questions about your personality and experience and then 4 programming assignments where 2 of them had to be solved. Upon successfully completing the screening I was invited to come to the Microsoft Campus where I was to spend 5 hours being interviewed by 4 interviewers. 3 of the interviews all had a short talk about myself and I could ask about them (the interviewers were Microsoft engineers themselves) and then they had a code problem that they asked me to solve. So each interview had a focus area and for me the areas were: algorithms and data structures, testing, and general software architecture. The last interview was with the manager about how good a fit I was with the company and was more about my personality and how I handled different situations.

Applied online initially, was contacted within a few days by a recruiter that dealt with University recruiting from my alma mater. Recruiter was very helpful in explaining the different positions in SW (SDE, SDET, & PM) and spent the phone interview with him deciding which position best fit my interests. No technical questions on phone interview. Contacted me shortly after to let me know a position was available for SDET at the Mountain View location. Set up in person interview and flew out to see them. Spoke with an amazing team that worked on Outlook. Had a total of five interviews throughout the day. 1) First interview, great guy. Really fun to talk to, discussed testing, reliability via redundancy and other issues and challenges of distributed systems. Technical Question: how would you test the responsiveness of one node from another node in a network of two connected servers. 2) Second interview, also a great guy. Worked on test automation and talked to me about various testing schemes and benchmarks they observe and work on. Technical Question: how would you test that two strings are anagrams of each other. 3) Third interview, really nice guy too but he was fiddling around with his phone while I was working on the technical problem on the whiteboard which made me feel like I was a high school teacher trying to get him to understand and pay attention. Talked about his work testing the products on various consumer personal electronic devices. Technical Question: describe and implement a search algorithm. (I picked quicksort) 4) Fourth interview, cool guy. Talked about the company and opportunities in the future. Grilled me on academics (my GPA, why it was what it was, what else I was doing in college, etc.) Technical Question: picked one of the projects on my resume and asked me to explain it to him as if he's a 6th grader. 5) Fifth interview, also a really great guy. Fun to talk to also spoke with him about Microsoft the team and what they were doing. He was an international transplant so I asked him about opportunities across the globe with the company. I forgot how to do the simplest brute-force solution for the problem and spent A LOT of time on the question trying to figure out a generalized pattern that would serve to give me an efficient algorithm. He presented me with the simplest, recursive, "try every board configuration" solution, mentioned that I know Dijkstra found the solution to it, but I can't remember it. He chuckled a bit. Technical Question: 8 queens problem. Outside of the actual interviews and on-campus experience which was the best part of my trip everything else sucked, nobody's fault though just a couple of those Acts of God that come with travelling. For example, on my drive to the interview I got caught for 45 minutes on the OFF RAMP to the campus. Not even the highway traffic, just the one off ramp had morning rush hour cause I guess Google and some of the other guys also had their campuses down the street.

Started with sending a CV to them and got a reply very quickly (2 - 3 Days) with a technical evaluation form with some small coding tasks, some testing questions (How would you test a pen) & other general questions. After returning the technical evaluation form, I heard back very quickly once again. Was informed there are openings in 2 different teams because my CV & Technical Evaluation form had been selected from a bunch to be interviewed for an additional team, instead of the team that most interns would be picked for. I then was scheduled for a face to face interview with the team leader the following monday and was offered the place 2 hours after leaving the interview. The entire process took less than 1.5 weeks.

During the face to face interview it was very informal but in the majority it was a technical interview, wasnt once asked anything like 'Tell me a bit about yourself'. The closest I came to this question was, tell me about your computer, which I was able to answer like a breeze because I finished building it 1 month prior. During the 1 hour interview, we barely sat down. In the room was myself, the team leader and what I believe to be a developer currently on the team. We were all in a small conference room and I was being asked questions and being asked to write small code samples on a whiteboard. The questions elaborated upon my technical evaluation form which I completed at the start of the process. Going through my pieces of code, how could I improve it etc. The interview also had some abstract questions, I believe these were to assess my thought processes.   Answer Question

Recruiter contacted me after I gave my resumé in a campus presentation. Then he scheduled an interview to the end of the month in a hotel in my town. The interview was short. Initially, we talked for about ten minutes about topics such as: why do I would like to work at Microsoft, previous experiences, which position I thought I'd fit better, etc. The interviewer was nice and made me very comfortable. Then he took me to a whiteboard and asked me to code an API to deal with two classes: Activity and Resource. An activity could use a lot of resources and then I had to save those objects and manipulate them with simple operations like insertion, deletion, etc. Nothing too hard but it required me knowledge on exceptions, threads, dangling references, etc.

I was contacted by a recruiter through a referral and got a call for the interview in a couple of weeks. It went for about 45 minutes and the interviewer asked me questions about auto scaling, load balancing and a lot of questions on distributed systems. He asked me to implement a queue, which was easy. After a couple of weeks, I was flown to Redmond and had 4 back to back interviews. The range of questions varied a lot in all the interviews. I had to explain in detail about the projects I had worked on and infact 1 of the interviews was solely based on one of my most complicated projects that required a lot of knowledge about distributed systems, nosql, sql, scaling. He asked me issues existing in current system and how to make changes to the current implementation to take care of a huge number of requests made to the database. All in all, the whole process was pretty exciting. I was nervous at first but the moment I met with my first recruiter, I became confidant and composed.

Interviewed once on university campus, interviewer seemed bored and distant, asked a question regarding string manipulation that wasn't particularly difficult. Interview in Redmond was alright, I really enjoyed the algorithm problems. The team was great, I dressed in business (very) casual; most of my interviewers were in jeans and a t-shirt, one was not. They didn't care what language I implemented my algorithms in, so I would generally use pseudocode initially and then drop into various languages to see what the interviewers were familiar with. Very professional overall.

The on-site interview consisted of five technical questions; code was required for four of the five: 1. Write a small parser for strings that determines whether a string is a sequence of space-separated words 2. Write an API for working with a specific type of document 3. Given an undirected cyclic graph, find all paths from A to B without cycles 4. The delivery of the fourth question was very confusing - basically they wanted me to implement a stack as a means of counting parentheses 5. Given a function prototype and a return value, hypothesize regarding 'what happened' The on-campus interview was a single technical question; the interviewer was extremely bored: A.

I responded immediately and gave my availability (which ended up being only one day), and then never heard from them until NOON OF THAT DAY, when they asked if I could come in at 2 PM. I had given up on the interview by then, but I agreed to come in even though I was unprepared.

I gave my resume to a recruiter at a campus recruiting event. The recruiter gave me an on-the-spot mini (~2mins) interview about a project I had listed on my resume. A few weeks later I got a call from the recruiter asking if I'd like to do a first round interview on campus. The first round interview consisted of two 30 minute parts. The first was with the recruiter and we went over some of my background and other things that were on my resume. "Tell me about this project you've got on your resume.", "Why do you want to work at Microsoft?", "What is your favourite piece of technology you own and how could you improve it?" were some of the questions asked along with some chat about a sport I had listed on my resume that we both played. The recruiter also asked how I would test a physical computer keyboard. The second part was with a technical interviewer who asked me to write a function that would return the number of 1's in the binary representation of an integer that was given as input. I wasn't prepared for this at all but the interviewer was really good and gave me good hints to get me to the solution in the end.

Two sessions of interview of 30 minutes each: First session was a technical review where a technical question was given to be solved in 30 minutes. The question I received was a bejewel-like game and the task was to code the function to start the game with initial game state. Second session was a 1 to 1 interview question where the interviewer followed up on your resume details as well as asked several expected questions such as reason of wanting to join the corporate and what is your passion in regards of technology.

Initial on campus screening.

HR would arrange the whole process. It really depends on the team. But mostly multiple people interview and there will be a senior person in the end to decide to make the offer or not. For SDET leader, they mostly look for leadership and technical ability. Expect technical questions. Ability to think. Work to work with team. Action oriented and result oriented. Technical coding is most important.

Typical Microsoft interview process. Not very different from Amazon or Google. There are tons of interview questions and tips available in books and online. You usually go through a HR phone call, may be a pre-screening, then a technical screening usually over the phone and finally 4-6 rounds onsite. The onsite interviews is a "biased" interview - interviews share information. If your interview stops at no 3, you probably didn't make it. Even if you make it to the hiring manager interview, it is not a sure thing.

I almost missed out because they typed my email wrong and they'd been trying to contact me for weeks. I had an on campus interview with some relatively straightforward questions. I was invited to visit on their campus. They had a nice set up with reimbursements etc, but they booked me the worst flight imaginable (I had to sleep on a bench at O'Hare). The interview went okay. I had one interview that was good and I answered questions correctly except for a brain teaser type question that I couldn't get more than a basic answer for. Another interviewer and I had a lot of trouble communicating. He saw I put Java on my resume (which I shouldn't have given how rusty I was) and kept posing his questions in Java despite my request for C/C++. The final interview had a bit manipulation/algorithms question. The interviewer said I had the most concise and efficient answer he'd seen. I also had a nice, long conversation with this guy about the company and how it's grown and other things. He, more than anything else made me want to work there.

Met at job fair, had about a one hour in-person interview on my campus soon after where I wask asked about my resume and background and a few simple coding tasks concerning strings. This man was very charismatic and happy to be working at Microsoft, he was quite different from the interviewers I met in Seattle, but he did his job well and made me excited to work there. Was later contacted for an on-site interview in Seattle. Was flown in for an overnight stay and went through 4 interviews the next day. The first one was easy, a few operations on linked lists, although the interviewer did not seem excited or happy to be doing the interview, seemed like he just drew a short straw. The second was worse, the interviewer seemed to have a large ego and felt the need to correct everything I said (including things like why I like programming and what my favorite project was), I just attempted to remain polite. He asked me about finding the largest consecutive sum in an array. Although I managed to put something together, I do not feel it was what he was looking for and he showed me his solution which I questioned and never got a satisfactory answer for (I was afraid to push him further because we were short on time and he seemed very firm in his ideas and I was far too nervous and tired). I don't feel he fully understood the question he asked me himself and that he just chose it from a list. The next interviewer I had lunch with, then a few more questions such as iterative and recursive fibonacci, approaching new code, etc. He also had a piece of paper and seemed to be choosing questions from a list. He was young and personable although he seemed very tired and beaten down. My final interview seemed to be with a higher-up manager, he was older and seemed to have more influence over Windows 8 features (he was able to point to some of the decisions he had made on the tablet interface). He was very laid back and didn't really ask anything specific. Rather, he simply asked what I liked, then discussed it, asked for some code examples. He seemed very experienced in giving interviews and somewhat jaded about it, but nothing too difficult.

The guy who called me wasn't a developer, someone from HR. He was asking questions about my past experience, previous job-related questions, one puzzle and other questions about most used programming languages, my favorite software, what I would like to improve. The puzzle was about nine pieces of marble. They're all equal, except one which is heavier than others. You have balanced weights and you have to find the heaviest one by weighting only twice. I'd encountered this problem before and solved it, so during the interview, I guess I solved too quickly.

I was contacted by a recruiter via mass email which stated there was a hiring event for the Cloud OS team. The email directed me to send a reply email with my most current resume and fill out a survey which asked general questions about my education, goals, and professional (coding/project) experience. The same recruiter called me back within two days and we chatted briefly about my career goals. After a 30 minute (non-technical) chat the recruiter invited me to take the OTS which would be a basic skills assessment on elementary concepts such as trees, linked lists, queues, etc. "some things I may not have seen in a while." I'm not through with the process but I wanted to get this question up before I forgot it as there were not a lot of example questions online re: the OTS. I hope it helps someone else!

Applied online and after a month or so heard back and was invited to attend a back to back interview on campus, one with a recruiter, one with an engineer. Both were really pleasant, the engineering interview was a simple programming task done on a laptop: write a function which given a string will return if it contains correctly matched open and closed parentheses. Expanded to include other types of brackets and return if all were correctly matched. I heard back very quickly informing me I had made it through to the final round on site assessment day. Couldn't make the first couple of interview dates offered so was eventually invited to travel to Redmond for an interview day at the main offices. Organizing travel was very easy and everyone involved was incredibly helpful. On the day, arrived at building 111 for mid morning. Was guided around campus and taken to the commons for a free lunch. We visited the visitors center and the company store and were invited to buy up to $120 of discount merch. We then returned to 111 for the interviews. We were each allocated a division we'd be interviewing for (this was not shared before the first interview). We were each interviewed by four interviewers who asked a variety of question covering fundamentals of computer science and some advanced material. We had a ten minute gap between each interview in which the examiners compared notes before we were launched into the next one. Asked technical questions on a number of topics, sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities, binary trees and binary search trees, low level computer scheduling and atomicity of operations, and an abstract data type question. I've provided examples of a small number of questions below. These were mixed in among other behavioral questions, attitudes, what do you do for fun, what's important when implementing software, how to interact with team members etc. It was generally very broad with lots of interesting questions; I wouldn't say especially hard but thats all relative... If you know the field and are well prepared you shouldn't find anything too tough... Don't worry about making mistakes, I know I sure made a couple, the key is checking back over your solutions as you go, work with test cases and when you identify a shortcoming, work out how you can fix it. TALK OUT LOUD! They don't care if you get stuck in a circle as long as they can see your thought process and why it's happening. If you've overlooked something they will happily drop a hint and see if you can rectify. My biggest tip would be friendly and relaxed, make it more of a conversation than a rigid interview. I almost got the feeling they were more interested in my personality than what I wrote on the board, so make it easy for them to like you: At the end of the day the big question they're asking themselves is, 'would I like to work alongside this person', not just 'can he do the work'. Overall, my interview was incredibly positive, everyone was super friendly and did their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The company was very generous with arranging travel, accommodation etc and first and foremost Microsoft seemed an incredible place to work. Go for it, give it your best shot, what is there to lose?

After about a month I got an email asking me to fly to Redmond for a day of onsite interviews. I gladly flew to Redmond. Treatment and process was really good. Everything went smoothly and they even gave money to spend on food and exploring Seattle. As for the actual interviews there were 4 back to back interviews. The first 3 were more based on coding on a white board and typical behavioral questions. The 4th one was a design based interview. Overall the interviews weren't too hard, but sadly I didn't prepare enough for them.

the culture is all indian in microsoft,and it lacks creativity which is a drawback i got hired on christmas and excited and the interview went well...When I was a corporate executive in the area of strategic planning, I quickly learned a very important lesson – the best way to ensure strategy implementation is to hire the right people into the company. I suppose that’s why I’m always surprised at the casual and often lackadaisical attitude many managers take when it comes to hiring. Look around and what you’ll notice is at the heart of most great companies is an incredibly strong emphasis on the hiring process.

process “as the most important strategic planning your company needs.” Why? Because every new employee will either improve the organization or lower it – and managers should be seeking and hiring employees who will enable the company to grow and to become more profitable. McKeown provides four tips for hiring great people: 1) Forget trying to ask magic bullet questions, 2) Ensure you have clearly defined what it will take to be successful in the position, 3) Test candidates, and 4) Include others in the hiring process.   Answer Question

It was the second round of on-campus interviews for SDE position. 45 minutes in length. The first one had gone fine. Was asked on BST in the first one.

I was asked to code semaphores and implement locks and race conditions. Shared reader-writer model. There is a shared data structure, and multiple processes access it. If there is a reader, another process can read it, but no process can write to it. If there is a writer, no process can read. A reader count needs to be maintained, and only if all the readers are done reading, can any process write to the shared data structure.   1 Answer

But they should be doing a better job screening people and not just randomly asking developers with no testing experience to interview for a testing position. Coding test was to write code to get all palindromes in a string. On-site interviews were hectic, you try and prove your testing and simple coding skills. Test a refrigerator. Code to make diagonal elements 0 in a matrix.

Interview process was very pleasant. I had a single phone interview (problem solving in nature) and was then flown out to Redmond a month or so later. Microsoft gives you plenty of resources to do the things you want while you're out there, so take advantage of it. They'll pay for cab fares, but I recommend getting a rental, to make sure that you're on time to wherever you need to be. On the interview day, I was shuttled to HQ with a group of other candidates (about 15 others). We had lunch and learned about the interview process. There were a total of 4 45 minute interviews, each with a different person. Each interview was pretty similar: about 15 minutes getting to know you and about 30 minutes of coding/problem solving. The questions weren't too bad...make sure your answers are geared towards a testing standpoint.

A question that I was not ready for was a networking question: about how traceroute works. The interviewer gave hints. It had to do with the TTL of a packet.   Answer Question

Interviewer asked a bit about college experiences, previous programming experiences/portfolio, and some technical questions.

The recruiting team does a great job, they are very helpful and always willing to help. On the day of your interview take full advantage of your recruiters by asking about the company, background of engineers working there and what they expect out of their potential hires, although you may know a lot about the company from online sources, I would recommend asking the recruiters these questions as you will get a clear idea. Focus on a lot of functional test cases first especially when they ask you to test the code you write, dont worry about where it is used and which application makes use of this code as you may waste time in clarifying and get lost in thoughts, as the interviewer would say, I just need functional test cases. But remeber when they ask you to test a application or some real world about then think in a methodical fashion like Test environment, Use Cases, Functional Tests, Special Test cases like Globalization tests, integration etc. Make sure you understand the question. Some times they may not give all the details in the question they ask, they want to see how you get the most information out of them. Dont proceed without understanding the question! and also make confirm whether you are allowed to use additional data structures or helper functions. You may have read that you have to think aloud when you write a program, if it works for you great follow that. For some people like me, I usually get lost in thoughts if I do that, so what I did was I told the interviewer I will take 5 mins to analyse the problem and come up with the solution and I will explain it step by step. If you get stuck just dont stare at the board, tell the interviewer your logic and where you are getting stuck, as they may give you hints which are very helpful. First round is usually is easy, they want you to get comfortable, so dont ignore programs like fibonacci, common factor, which are very basic problems. As the rounds progresses it becomes harder.Your energy levels and the thinking speed drops as you cruise through the day. Make sure you have practice working on problems for long time period(). For this just like a week before, try to setup a mock interviews with yours friends stretched out for a day packed with five 45 minutes interview with 15 min break or if your friends are busy ask your friend to randomly pick problems write them into a piece of paper and place them into 5 different files. Try to work on them the whole day. Trust me this will definitely help you. On the day before the interview please please relax and get a lot of sleep dont try to read something you dont know cause it messes up things which you know and drops your confidence levels. Focus on String manipulation, Lists, Tree traversals, very very important topics for a microsoft interview. Learn from the mistakes other people did, trust me it will make you better a programmer. Good Luck fellow programmers!!!!

An on-campus interview followed with 3 onsite interviews, including one lunch interview. The on campus interview was easy, we talked about the projects I am doing, my professional interests and solved a designing problem, in other words, I designed a state machine. Then I got my first on-site interview. I was interviewed with Bing Ads. The first round went on pretty good, some basic problems playing with numbers and data structures. But I was a bit slow writing codes. The second round was an lunch interview, we had lunch in their dining hall and we talked about our personal interests, and the discussed about technologies I am interested in. I said knect. He asked me if I were supposed to add one function to Xbox, would I add, and we continued our conversation on how to realize this technology. Afterwards we grabbed a cup of tea and went back to his office, and solved a coding problem. The third round has two problems, both of them asked me to deal with a char string.

It was what you expect from a Microsoft interview. I was contacted for an on-campus interview. The interviewer was very quiet, but he knew what he was talking about. He asked the standard fare of behavioral questions and then asked the technical question. The solution he offered me wasn't correct though, not that I answered it correctly either. Additionally, it seemed he didn't have much mobility in the company since he said he has been in part of the team for the Start button for years now.

First got a phone interview. The interviewer asked a lot about personal experience and prjects etc. And then dived in the questions. There are three questions. One is about sorting a stack using only another stack. Can be resolved using insertion sort. Another is about circular linked list, which I found particularly difficult to answer on the phone. The last is about memory limit concern in large system design. Probably I listed OS dev in my resume. A conceptual question. Answered pretty nicely I think.

Once you get in contact with a Microsoft recruiter they make sure to response fast and make sure the hiring process is very clear. I knew what to expect and the recruiters are quick to respond to questions. The first round of interviews was very basic. They then offer to fly you out and pay for everything. The interview day was pretty long but exciting and high intensity. I actually enjoyed it very much though and got to meet plenty of other candidates. At the end of the day I met up with some people I met and we all went out to explore Seattle. We went to this amazing seafood restaurant which was delicious. Microsoft paid for everything, they really want you to have an amazing experience and sell the company to you. I was given an offer one or two hours after my last interview which was really surprising and exciting at the same time. The recruiters really jump on you quick and are urgent / excited to hear your response. I ended up accepting the offer the next day. In the end, it was a very pleasant and amazing experience and I'm looking very much forward to the summer!

The process started off with my campus recruiter re-sending an email about a potential phone interview. Turns out the first email was sent straight to spam (bad Google! Folks, check your spam folder every now and then). I replied, and she set up a phone interview for me a few weeks later. Phone interview: Morning phone call with some pretty standard questions. The msft employee was fairly nice and wanted me to code the questions (can't remember but I'd guess they were string searches and character counting programs) and send them to his microsoft.com email address. A few days later I got an email from my campus recruiter saying I did well, and she'd like to know some teams that I might be interested in interviewing with. Redmond: On the morning of the interview I met with my recruiter at the recruiting building 111 where she handed me details of my first interview and what team I was interviewing for. What followed was the standard microsoft interview loop (meet with a person, interview for an hour, then be asked to wait in the coffee lounge while the interviewer goes to talk to the next person). After meeting three people, I was asked to meet their manager, and after that, his manager! A few days later I got an email saying that they would like to move ahead with an offer!

I had dropped my resume at the university career fair and got a call for an on-campus interview a couple of weeks later. It was an easy one with one technical question (Perform a level-wise traversal in a binary tree) and a few HR questions. Another couple of weeks later I got a call for the on-site interview for SDET position. I have to say Microsoft really pampers the candidates and gives a very good first impression. I was flown to Redmond and put up in Westin. Limos were arranged to pick me up from the airport to hotel and from hotel to/from Microsoft campus. It was a day long affair with 4 back to back interviews and the recruiters made sure that the time between the interviews was relaxing and helped a great deal to reduce the stress of an interview. Interview 1 A small coding problem which wasn't really difficult. I was then asked to test a parking garage. Make sure that you cover all possible scenarios and test cases. I was pretty satisfied at the end of this interview. Interview 2 This was a young enthusiastic guy but it turned out to be the worst interview for me of the day. We started with test cases for some function, and it went pretty well. Then he asked me to come up with a method to find anagrams in a dictionary and then kept making the requirements and scenario more complex after each proposed solution. I came very close to the optimal solution, but even then I felt I took too much time in doing so. His feedback was that I should be asking more for the problem details instead of concentrating directly on solving it. It was a good point to remember but at the end of the interview I felt I could have done way way better and was a bit disappointed. Interview 3 This interview in fact began while we were walking from the conference room to the interviewer's office. We talked about my interests, why Microsoft etc etc. And then came the most stressful part. He asked me how I would test a toaster that is supposed to toast bread in outer space. Interesting problem, and thanks to the feedback from the 2nd interview I spent a great deal of time clarifying the conditions in which it would be used, who will use it etc etc. I must have come up with at least around 30-40 cases, but he kept staring at me as if I was missing out something obvious. I guess he wanted to test if I could think under pressure. This went on for about 20-30 minutes. We ended up with a small coding exercise and I was happy with my performance. Interview 4 I was quite tired by this time and I think it showed. The interviewer had been there for 13 years and he was very comforting. He then asked me to test a particular function. We went over many test cases and once we were done, he told me to write the code for it. This was fun because I had to ensure that my code passes all the test cases that I have come up with myself. He helped me a bit along the way and it went smoothly. We, the candidates were then taken for lunch and then were free to roam around the campus. Happened to see Steve Balmer too (he was busy on his phone). I returned back to the hotel and slept the whole evening. My flight was the next day morning and they had given me taxi voucher's to cover the fare. Got the offer the following week. I was a bit apprehensive since I felt my 2nd interview may screw up my chances, but I guess it did not. I accepted it and now I am totally looking forward to joining them.

First went through University Recruiting. On-campus interview had one tech question: check if you have a valid combination of '(', '{', '['. Second round, aka final round was on-site in Seattle. Each has a 45-min duration and you have a 15 minutes break in between 4 interviews in this round. First one: given the pointer to a head node that contains 2 pointers pointing to any other 2 nodes(like a simplified graph), you need to make a deep copy of this graph. Second one: check if a BST is a valid BST Third one: given a list of stock prices, you need to find the date when you buy and sell the stock so that your profit is max Fourth one: you have a stream, you need to check if the stream contains a specific string in it. The stream can tell you if it is EOF. You cannot use any STL; you need to write strlen if you need it, you need to write IsSubstring if you want to use it.

The first and the last one are fairly complicated. Mainly because the first one you need to DFS/BFS the graph and then use a hashmap to prevent re-creating existing nodes. The second is such a test for your pointer arithmetic and manipulation................   Answer Question

Given a string of only 0s and 1s, find the maximum length of equal number continuous 0s and 1s, such as 111000, 00001111.

Did not expect math problems. They gave me a expression and let me find as accurate as possible the Lower Bound and Upper Bound. Bit level problems are also difficult to me.   1 Answer

Microsoft came to the job fair at my university, where I was able to talk to one of the engineer, and submitted my resume. The university recruiter responsible for my university sent me an email a few days later, inviting me to the on-campus interview. The 1st round of on-campus interview was not difficult. I was asked to merge 2 sorted linked lists. Since I finished it quickly, I get to ask a lot of questions. Around 2 weeks after the 1st interview, I got an email from the university recruiter that I passed the 1st round. Another recruiter from Redmond would get in touch with me. After another 2 weeks, I got an email inviting me to interview on-site. It was difficult to schedule the interview at a time that suits me -- there were several recruiters, several schedulers, you know, big corporation. But they do try to accommodate my requests and we finally managed to find a date that makes everyone happy. The interview day started very early. We were asked to wait in our hotel lobby at 6:45 am. The van left at 7:00 am. The recruiter met us in the lobby of the building at 7:30. She gave a presentation about Microsoft, the interview schedule, etc. And we started to interview with the engineers at 8:00. There were 4 rounds of interviews, 45 minutes each, with 15 minutes break in between. Afterwards, the whole group went to have lunch together. When we came back, the recruiter talked to us one by one, informing us about the results right away.

Submitted resume at a campus career fair. Heard back a couple weeks later to schedule an on-campus interview. The on campus interview was a half hour long and had just two questions:     1. Given two nodes in a tree, find their ancestor     2. Given a function that does some bit operations, determine what it does and find the bug. About 2 weeks after the on-campus interview I was informed that I would be moving forward in the interview process. This was one negative of the process for me, because I was asked to interview for a position nowhere near the locations I specified as being my preferred choices. The team I interviewed with was also quite different that the interests I discussed in my campus interview. The hiring event consisted of 4 45-60 minuter interviews. Each interview varied a bit. Some of the other people interviewing received nearly all design questions while others had mostly coding/algorithm questions. I had a mix of design and coding questions which were done on the whiteboard. For all of the coding/algorithm questions time and space requirements were discussed as the approach was talked through. No specific requirements were given at the start of a question, but the resulting complexities had to be discussed and justified. Some questions related to balancing the time and space requirements. Test cases were also discussed for each question ranging from use cases to catching integer overflow. The final design question was very open ended, which I think actually tripped me up a bit because after several focused technical questions, I had trouble thinking from a broad design point of view. Overall, I felt the interviews all went well, but with no feedback from the interviewers I can't say what it was that kept me from getting an offer.

1. Given a non-negative integer array that is then shuffled and 1 element is removed, find which element was removed.  2.

Had an on campus interview, with 30mins coding and 30mins behavioral. After that, had an on-site interview with 4 Microsoft employees, each interview taking 45mins. All were coding + testing questions, and the questions were the types you would typically find in an interview preparation coding book. Overall the process was very enjoyable and the interviewers were very nice and engaging

Just be thorough with the data structures (trees, strings, recursion etc) and practise a lot. Most of the questions are similar to programming questions found in a book, and if you practise enough, you will be confident for all the questions. Also, testing questions are always unique (like test a vending machine), and make sure you cover all the test cases.   Answer Question

I applied online on my college job portal and got a mail from the recruiter 3 weeks later asking me to schedule a 30 mins on-campus interview. The interviewer was very friendly and asked a lot of questions from my resume and prev work experiences. After that she asked me to design an employee feedback application that would record the employee's goals/ achievements and the manager would review it. I was asked to come up with design pattern for this problem and think of all possible test cases. It was a very open-ended question so I wasn't sure I covered all. Nevertheless got a call after 15 days asking me to come onsite. I had 4 1:1 technical rounds on-site. All the interviewers were very friendly. They gave us a tour of the campus and took us to the store. They really treat the candidates well and gave us pretty awesome coupons to be used at the store. The interviews were a mixture of coding, design, behavioural, puzzles and resume questions. A lot of distributed network questions were asked. It is good to have an all-rounded preparation. Don't just concentrate on Data structures and OOPS. Some of the questions were: "How would you design the swimming pool for a resort in Mexico?" "What data structure would you use for a website like Ancestry.com and how and why." Had to write code for this "You have a website that displays the stock prices of every company everyday with trends. How would you test the accuracy of data displayed in the website?" "You have billions of strings sorted in an array. You don't have any access to it. You just have a method that returns the string pertaining to a index. Use only that method to find the location of a given string" I started out at 0(n^2) and kept on improving to o(logn) After that, they gave me the results very next day. That was pretty nice of them.

Got a mail requesting for an interview at University. The interviewer asked questions about my experience and a coding question involving multiple threads and some general algos questions. After clearance, recruiter contacted me to schedule onsite interviews at Redmond. At the campus, the day started with a chat with HR and then a total of 6 technical rounds(including 1 lunch technical round, from different teams in the Core OS group). Questions asked were generally core OS(multithreading, deadlocks, concurrency), algorithms(simple ones with complete coding) and some on work experience. Overall, the experience was nice and the interviewers were very friendly. Two days later, I got a reject mail. The reason for my reject(acc to me) is my substandard implementation of a stack using an array compounded by my miserable performance in the last round. I felt that the interviewers exchange the performance of the candidate about a possible weakness and the next interviewer will look to confirm that, and if that's the case, the red flags would be raised.

Skype or phone interview are exactly the same since the interviewer would not request for a video chat through skype.

How would you design an alarm clock for blind people? 3. There are three baskets with apples, oranges and mix of apples and oranges. Each basket has a tag with apple, orange or mix. Now we know that all the three tags are wrong. You have only one opportunity to pick one fruit from one basket. How you will choose to identify these three baskets?

Two rounds of interviews on-campus at my school, followed by on-site interviews. On-site interviews were in a large group of students, with two interviews back-to-back followed by lunch. Everyone received decisions after lunch. Overall things were pretty smooth. I heard back quickly after each round of interviews, and Microsoft paid for all expenses while traveling there for the on-site round. Definitely one of the smoother experiences I've had. The only downside is they don't have access to any feedback when giving your result, which means they can't even tell you how long until you can reapply (because it depends on how close you were to hire/no hire), so you'll have to email your recruiter separately and hope for a response.

Almost entirely data structures and algorithms questions. Nothing overly atypical. Surprisingly, didn't even get the "why do you want to work at Microsoft?" question that I've heard is really common.

I did not give good answer to them because I have not done development coding for a while during my graduate study, and hence got rejected.

Everything about Microsoft's interview process is great! Start - Apply on website / on-campus / through recruiter First - Phone screen / on campus interview (EASY) Second - Fly out to Seattle for full day interviews (MEDIUM) End - You usually get a few weeks to reply to the offer, I got a month They usually don't tell you what team you'll be interviewing for, but it doesn't matter. They don't ask you anything specific about the team anyway. Almost everything in the Seattle trip is covered including room service, rental car, meals, etc. They really treat their candidates well. The interviews take a few hours (4 rounds of 45-50minute interviews on a whiteboard at their office) and range from medium to hard difficulty. They don't tell you too much about the company/offer/process from the get-go but are very friendly and respond to any questions you have quickly. I would highly recommend going through this process especially if you have a negative impression of Microsoft. The 'evil' rumors just simply aren't true - and the company is great. Their compensation package is top-notch and would easily match Google/Facebook/etc. The disposable income you get is probably more than you'd get anywhere else given that Washington has 0% state income tax, and the living expenses in Seattle are reasonable.

The communication started through career fair. When I gave my Resume to one of their representative (current Engineer at Microsoft), he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. Later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. I had to raise my eyebrow here, cause the guy has my Resume and he asked me several questions. This alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. Reading other posts, it seems MS conducts onsite campus interviews, then why forward to recruiter. Perhaps, due to lower reputation of my university, they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite. A couple of weeks later, I got an email to schedule a phone interview. At last, something is better than nothing as I get about half an hour to prove my capacity. I have gone through interview posts here on Glassdoor and I could not find any details on phone interviews. Most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. In any case, I prepared myself with the questions posted and later on I realized those were overkill for the phone interview. Now, I have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. In most cases, I have made it to later rounds in phone interview, but no onsite though. Well, I just want to say I have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews, both technically and behaviorally. The interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. This was already done when I submitted my Resume, so I see no point in reiterating all this. Although, I was asked similar questions in my past interviews, but on those occasions, I did not forward my Resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when I spoke to someone inside the company. Next I was asked several semi-technical and behavioral questions. Most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere, therefore I will not emphasize much on those. However, I will mention some of them below, cause I think it's on these questions I may have under performed. As for other questions, I am sure "Design a Table", "Test an Elevator" and "Determining Apple, Orange and Apple-Orange from incorrectly labelled boxes" should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet. Few days later, I got the usual no offer email. The only positive thing I can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. From what I know, they usually give a 1 year clause, therefore this was a good rejection, I hope. I did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection. I will discuss them in Question sections below. Perhaps you guys could judge if this is certainly worth getting a rejection.

Had a number of discussions with HR recruiters, followed by a two phone screens (one position I declined on the screen right away) and the second phone screen resulting in on-campus interviews for two positions. Scheduled for 6-one hours interviews + lunch with a co-worker. However, one of the two jobs got filled before my interview so I ended up speaking with just one group, 5-one hour interviews + lunch session (fairly standard MS procedure). Every one was really good to talk to. No need to fake anything. Be honest. Say you don't know to things you don't know or can't remember on the spot. Ask questions. Be social. The people you speak to are going to be your peers and mentors so they need to feel a sense of comfort with you too. You need to show your willingness to learn and being open to their ideas and suggestions. Don't make the mistake that I made -- stayed up for 26 hours before catching 3 hours of sleep and then going into the interview. By the end of the day, you are so numb and brain dead. Get plenty of sleep, light breakfast. For some reason, every interview asked me if I need to use the rest room before and after every session... Anyway, good to place to work, great overall interview experience minus the one hiccup about the job being filled after I was invited to interview for the role.

A couple of open ended questions on designing a set of classes for a given problem, another question on some binary math-magic...was taking me a while to understand this, but that was probably due to the lack of sleep... next morning, i woke up with a light bulb hanging over my head and a clear answer/solution.   Answer Question

Came to our career fair. Interviewed people there, shortlisted and called sent invitations for on-site process.

On campus interview questions: 1) Find the middle of a linked list 2) Find all the paths in a binary tree that sum up to a given value 3) Write test cases for bing (yeah, really!) On site interviews: - Interview 1: After discussing past projects. Write test cases for a routine that takes input 2 Cartesian coordinates and draws a line joining them, but the display pane can show points only such that x and y are between -100 and 100. How would you design it for a blind person. Choose the best 6 test cases and why. - Interview 2: After discussing my resume. Write code to find all the palindromes in a string. Code both naive and efficient approaches. What if the string had spaces also, like "race car", which is also a palindrome. What if characters similar to an alphabet, from other languages were also be considered as the same character. What if you were implementing a web service with a page that takes input string in a textbox and displays all the palindromes. What test cases would you write to see the service works fine. What of your service was being used only by people in Germany. How can you optimize? - Interview 3: After resume discussion, talks for 5 minutes about his team, MS Office Sharepoint. Just 1 question for the entire interview. Given an API with a string argument and an int return type, what could it be doing. Imagine the different possibilities and how would you decide the testcases, based on the functionality of the API you thought of. Think on test that assure sanity, +ve examples, -ve examples, security, scalability of the API. - Interview 4: Discusses my resume, talks about his team and shortly about his experience of 20 years at MSFT (at which I instantly remarked, I would have never been able to pull that off!). Says that I see from your feedback that you are more of a problem solver, so I would like to test your imagination. Asks me to implement string.Split(some char) API of C#. Write test cases that would fail my code. Write code to fix those failures, iterate till all are resolved. At the end, tries to sell me the SDET position, says it's lots of fun and SDE/SDET switching happens every couple of years. Otherwise, MSFT pampers it on-site invitees. They pick you up from the hotel and airport in a limo, $75/day just for meals, crazy discounts in the MSFT store, free taxi/rental car to explore the city and $50 reimbursable, apart from meals and taxis if you want to buy other stuff.   2 Answers

Recruiter came on campus and I was able to go on campus directly for an interview. I expressed interest in an UI role and they matched me with the least UI relevant team possible, which pretty much made me lose interest in my interviews. I didn't find out until interview day. Interviews vary depending on your performance and what the team needs, so they tell you 3-5. I got away with 4.5. The team asked a lot of data structures questions, which was fine, I struggled an appropriate amount and answered most of them. They seemed to be fine with my answers. Then my last interview was with the hiring manager, who basically told me no on the spot. He pretty much made circles with his words to avoid telling me no, which was kind of stupid. He told me that my experience was not enough for them and that I should go make some apps or do TopCoder. I was fine with not getting the job, but was not fine with the fact that I wasted my entire day interviewing for a team I had zero interest. I also felt that they should not have accepted the interview in the first place if they saw I didn't have relevant experience.

One interview. I am very confused with Microsoft's goals and public vs. private appearances. In public, they seem very interested in young, new ideas. They seem interested in trying to get back into the market. But in private, during developer's talks, and interviews, they seem very stuck to the same old Microsoft mentality that has led to them losing a large share of the Consumer Market. They seem to still be layering more problems and layers of complexity on top of their old, what I think is, ineffective system. They are trying to fix bugs, not by fundamentally changing this system which has allowed them to flourish, but by adding more layers of protection on top. Rather than listening to consumers they seem to be just trying what they think is right. During their advertisements to us Computer Science undergrads, they emphasize the fact that they are turning a corner, trying to recruit new ideas, that they are trying to increase diversity. But during my interview there was no sign of this at all. It was conducted by a white, older man who works on some low-level operating system part. He seemed really interested in just the details of the machine and what it is doing.

Applied through a university recruiting event. Talked to a recruiter then scheduled a technical phone interview. Did a basic programming problem on the phone (reverse a singly linked list), and a few days later I was invited to fly out to an on-site interview. Fast-forward a few weeks, I flew out to Seattle, WA. They put me up in the Westin (very nice hotel) and payed for everything. Opt for a rental car (it's free!) so you can explore the city when you're done on your own time. Microsoft now does most of their interviews in four hour intervals. I was assigned the morning interval (~8am - ~1pm), so the whole on-site interview didn't last more than 4 or 5 hours. They pick you up in a limo with the other candidates (there were a total of 16 of us). They brought the 16 of us into a holding room in a building on the campus. From there, the interviewers came and got a candidate to interview one by one. A total of four interviews were given (everyone got the same amount, no one was sent home early or anything). Each one was 45 minutes, with a 15 minute break in between. The interviews weren't too hard - reverse the words of a string (example i/p: sunny in seattle o/p: seattle in sunny). If you read through Cracking the Coding Interview, it's really not too bad. I've interviewed at Google and Amazon and those interviews were much harder. At some point in the interview they feed you food, usually a pasta. My advice would be to avoid all the carbs, as my group had two interviews, then lunch, then two more interviews. After lunch, the people that ate a lot of carbs (pasta) were about ready to fall asleep, despite having two more interviews. One thing to point out about these interviews is that they will drain you, similar to walking out of the SAT. A few kids actually fell asleep on the way home from the interview because they were so mentally exhausted, so make sure you pace and prepare yourself.

Applied through a campus recruiter, passed a phone interview, and took a trip to Redmond for an all-day interview. While people seemed nice, the company as a whole rubbed me the wrong way. The phone interview did not feel very welcoming and after talking to the various employees during the on-site interview, I got the feeling that Microsoft was a bit too paranoid. Developers only got to see fragments of a system (in this case, Windows 8 during its development) at a time and annual performance reviews ensured that no matter what, a percentage of the lowest performing engineers would be laid off (even if the lowest performing engineers were in fact well above average compared to other companies). None of the interviewers seemed to be happy with where they were and had a vibe that having to conduct an interview was almost not worth their time. The overall environment felt a bit too competitive and hostile for my taste. Ended up goofing on the on-site interview itself due to nervousness and being intimidated--it was not until a few days after that I realized those emotions were red flags.

Pretty standard questions. The first interview is designed to be easy (fib. sequence) and throughout the day, they'll get more complicated, mostly involving one or more data structures.   Answer Question

Microsoft visited my university and I gave my resume to them. They talked to me a little bit there and then sent me an email inviting me for an interview. The interview was in an hotel next to the subway station so it was easy to get there. The interviewer was extremely nice and gave me the opportunity to ask a lot of questions about the job and about the company. I've had to write some simple algorithms like reversing a linked list. Next, I've got an e-mail asking me to go to another city for the final interview day. They bought the plane tickets for me and booked a nice hotel. I've had three interviews there... on two of them I've had to write algorithm to solve problems with strings. On the other one I've had to create a test plan for a software. The interviewers were extremely nice, except for one. We have to solve all the problems on the whiteboard and there are some puzzles during the interview.

Write the algorithm for this: If you have a string aaabbc the output should be a3b2c1, for the string aabcc the output should be a2b1c2 and so on. You should not allocate memory for a new string and you can do this only by reading each character once. Ps: if the result is bigger than the original string (like abc -&gt; a1b1c1) just return null or some message that makes that clear.   3 Answers

The interview process is moderately tough. The interview is completely oriented towards problem solving questions only, no technology related questions and they expect you to write the code for the problem with all the kind of testing angles keeping it in mind, in short the code should be runnable and productizable as it is. The interview mail tells clearly what they are looking in a candidate I followed their instruction very religiously and I felt it helped me a lot to get offer. For example they say "Don't assume things, ask questions when not clear", it happened to me during the interview, initially they will ask questions with less clarity, so here you need to bring out all the assumptions you are doing etc, you can even ask hints also if required they will help you. Basically their goal is to understand is this guy thinking in right direction and with little help is he able to solve problems ????

Was contacted by a recruiter in late July after submitting my resume to Microsoft online several months prior. I had a phone interview scheduled for early August. This phone interview was a half hour long, and while it was with an HR person she did as a few technical questions, such as how to quickly find the middle element of a linked list. She also asked about how I would go about testing a vending machine. In another 2 weeks I was invited to interview in Redmond in late September for a SDET position. Microsoft booked my flight, hotel for 2 nights, and rental car. On the interview day, I was there with 7 other SDET candidates. We had lunch, and then a series of 4 interviews that lasted 45 minutes each with 15 minute breaks in between. Each interview was with a Test Manager, and each one consisted of a few minutes of talking about my resume and then some technical questions. After all the interviews were over, we were free to go for the day, and they told us we'd know by the next day if we would be getting an offer. I had the evening free and went to Seattle to explore a bit. The next morning I got an email informing me I wouldn't be getting an offer. Overall it was a difficult but exciting process (free trip to Seattle!). Microsoft will reimburse for most everything, so even if you're only slightly interested in the position, definitely take them up on the offer to interview.

Standard Microsoft interview--you have 4 interviews scheduled--one hour for 3 of them, and and hour and a half for the lunch interview. Interview flow starts out with some softball questions, typically about engineering, or previous experience, and then typically gets into coding questions, algorithms, white board analysis of a system (how to test it). If you do well you land the 5th "as appropriate" interview (typically with a higher level manager).

There were totally 2 rounds of Phone Interview. 1st round: "Given a linked list such that one node point to some random node, Write the clone method of a linked list." I was able to give an approximate solution in C# using Dictionary, the interviewer was helpful and encouraging inorder for me to come to exact solution. Couple of days later, got a call back from recruiter that I will be interviewed for 2 round of phone interview.

2nd round: "What is the data structure which suits best for the Battleship game? The board will be of size n x n, with m different ships each having k1, ..., km lengths. Each ship can either by place horizontally or vertically on the board. The structures should be designed such that they can support basic operations for playing a game. For example, the board and a particular (i, j) coordinate representing a position on the board may be passed into a function attack(). The function should return hit if a ship was hit at that position, sunk if a ship has sunk after being attacked at that position, and miss if no ship is at that position. Describe your design of the structures, what kind of data they store, and the runtime complexity of typical operations for playing the game (like the attack() function) as a result of your design decisions" I was coming with an O(n) solution during attack, which was my first attempt and then I was thinking about optimization. But by then the time was over and interviewer seemed unhappy with my solution or the attempt.   Answer Question

I was doing my masters in Singapore. Applied through the Microsoft's University Recruitment page in november. Was contacted for an initial phone screen which was pretty basic. Just basic profile plus a question to test my viability for a SDET role (How will you test a keyboard?). After around 15 days, I was confirmed for an onsite interview to be held in February. Interview consisted of 4 rounds of one-to-one interviewing of 1-hour each with a 15-minutes HR briefing in between each interview. Questions were mostly on algorithms, data structures and other concepts (such as recursion, C-S architecture etc.). After 3 rounds, all the interviewers meet and decide whether or not to go for a 4th round. They might reject you there and then or might accept you if you have been very good or in about 50% cases, go for another round. I was called for a 4th round and was given and offer within 10 mins of completion of 4th round.

Though i applied online to a position in Microsoft for more than a month, i only received the call from the recruiter a day after i got a reference. Now though i applied for a Program Manager position, the recruiter informed me that my profile suited another position: SDET 2 among the current openings. I never did have any formal testing experience prior in my career but when the recruiter mentioned that development was the integral part of the profile. My interview was with a Lead Tester whose questions were excellent analytical questions in Testing scenarios. He did not ask any typical technical questions (which otherwise can be googled). He was really testing my thinking on how i would test a product.

The process from sending the CV to the first interview took ~1 month. HRs had not responded for a long time. Then they arranged a phone interview with a senior developer from MS. The interview was quite brief. He asked a couple of general questions like 'what is your software development background?' 'what are you working on now?'. Then we came directly to programming. There was only one problem: determine whether two strings are anagrams, i.e. contain the same letters.

Anagram detection. This algorithm's complexity can be reduced to O(n) by counting frequencies of every letter from two words and comparing them. I didn't come to that - instead I suggested a O(n log n) algorithm. It seems that was my fault.   Answer Question

I attended an university recruiting. First a phone interview then on-campus interview in four stages. Phone interview was behavioral, but you get to be asked to provide some hacks mostly on tricky algorithmic questions at on-campus meetings. I did get through all the steps but couldn't get the job offer. As to my understanding you have to give (or at least on the way) decent answers in all of your interviews, even one recruiter hesitates then they look for someone else.

Questions are not always hard by itself but most of the time what they look is how you approach to the problem and in what way you could improve the code.   Answer Question

The interview process consist of 2 phases: - Phone interviews (1 or 2, 1h each), the scope of these interviews is to know the candidate and understand if it meets the requirements of the job position. The interview is organised in the following way:      - Technical questions: they depend on the job position, they are open questions about general or specific topics.      - Programming excercise: solve a problem by writing some code and discuss later the performance and traits of your code.      - Questions about the company and the position. - Face to face interviews: if you pass the phone interview(s), you will have 3 face to face interview (all in the same day). The organisation is the same as in the phone interview.

Technical questions are very difficult, but if you are well prepared on the requirement of the job position you will answer to most of them. Programming excersice are very difficul and challenging.   Answer Question

I first applied for the position while a recruiter was at my college for a job fair event. After that, I was contacted about a month or so later and scheduled a phone interview (or rather an online phone interview). The phone interview was all business, no personal questions. The interviewer asked me to start writing something that seemed somewhat simple, in whichever language I preferred. After a sufficient amount of time coding and asking questions (roughly 45 minutes) he had me stop and asked a couple of questions on my thought process in coding the answer. I was contacted a few days later and asked if I could fly out for an interview. I accepted and went to their headquarters in Washington. The day starts relatively early, around 9:30AM and goes "until you're finished". The basic process is they hand you the location of your first interview, either walk you there or get you a ride there, and continue handing you off between Microsoft employees that you will potentially be working with. Usually each person asks you a couple of personal questions and at least one coding question. Some people may seem like they're ignoring you or acting strangely around you, but I believe that's all part of the interview process. Asking questions is a vital part of the process, as they want someone who is willing to understand something from top to bottom before they attempt to write code for it. As some other reviews have said, towards the end of the day you may or may not meet with your fifth interviewer in the event that they may "be busy". Whether or not this is truly an indicator of your progress, I'm unsure. All I can say is I interviewed with four out of five people and did not receive the offer. Fortunately, I heard back the very next day, so there wasn't too much anticipation.

Most of the questions were difficult. Expect a lot of questions that really challenge your grasp on more advanced CS fundamentals.   Answer Question

Submitted my resume directly to the hiring manager. After one round of phone interview with hiring manager, I got invited to the onsite interview. In the beginning of the day, HR gave me a list of only three interviewers, all principal engineers. It was very friendly, mostly about my previous industry and PhD work and then some domain specific questions to test my knowledge in different corners in this field. After three rounds, if they don't like you, they may let you go immediately. For me, I have extra four more rounds. One is with a younger engineer who asked more about programming questions followed by another very senior person who asked pretty advanced questions in the field. And then one round with hiring manger who is very technical and asked questions from high level to low level in the field. The last round was a long long time interview with manager's manager. He basically introduced their projects and talk generally to me in different areas. It lasted two and half hours. I finished at 7:00PM.

When you arrive after numerous phone conversations they treat you like they never heard of you. It is a disorganized mess getting you to through the interview process. Questions are repeated because interviewers are making stuff up on the spot or using stuff they think are good questions they found from others or searching the internet. Instead of being treated like an individual you are tossed into a herd of cattle and treated worse than a military recruit your first day. Most of the process is ad hoc and hurried because they need to met a goal and a deadline for some checkbox on a review form. Good luck getting a computer, desk and other equipment such as a working phone or chair in the first 60 days. You will spend the first week at work standing in line or running around campus to deal with HR and hiring requirements for badges, network access, server access. There is some sort of mock Zen environment in which asking questions in order to do a better job or improve quality will cause you to receive strange looks, derision, and generally asked to go away because you are not on the review checklist.

6 hours worth of interviews, with people of various levels. The focus is on technical and testing skills, and less about cultural fit. It makes for a long day, so get plenty of rest the night before, take the interviewers up on their offers to get something to drink (stay hydrated). Focus preparation on coding and technical questions. As you think about the answer do your best to think out loud. It is just as much about how to get to the answer rather than getting the correct answer. Also - try not to get rattled by interviewers being jerks. It is common. Sometimes it is intentional to see how you react, sometimes you just get an inexperienced interviewer who has poor people skills.

They came to my university to do a presentation about MS recruiting, on this presentation they also asked for our resumes and did a really quick HR interview with everyone. The selected people from the previous step had an technical interview also on the university. In the interview I was asked 2 straight forward algorithm questions, and had some minutes to chat about MS culture and about the interviewer's daily life. After the previous step, some people were selected to do a on-site interview, mine was in São Paulo - Brazil. It consisted of 4 interviews, each interviewer were from a different project and asked totally different questions (usually one algorithm based and another different, sometimes were puzzles and sometimes just design discussions). Some of the interviewers were nice, some of them seemed to be having a tough day. They tell you the result right after the interview process.

Mostly there were problem solving questions and questions depending on your resume. I recall the following questions: 1.

Tested basics and programming skills. Were very interested in how motivated I was and application of problem solving and analysis. Questions - 1. Count the number of continuous letters in a string eg aaaabbccaaddd is a4b2c2a2d3. 2. Swap the odd and even positions of a linked list eg 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 becomes 2 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 5 3. Write a function bool IsPalindrome(string input) which return true if the string contains a palindrome. 4. A function takes in 3 ints as an input which are the lengths of possible triangle. Write the function to determine if the three sides can make a triangle, if yes then determine if equilateral, isosceles or scalene. I had 5 rounds of on site interviews 1st was a lunch interview 90 mins, then 3 1 hour interview and then a final round with the hiring manager. One interesting question by the hiring manager was "what was the one question you had expected ut were not asked?"

TO be honest, I never thought my experience with microsoft soft would be like this. I was contacted by a recruiter through email. I had an initial phone screen and it went well and was invited for an onsite interview. The first person who interviewed me was nice and kind. This round went well. The second interviewer was late by about 15 mins while I was waiting in the lobby. The person invited me to his room and started the interview. The question was not clear at all and the person just turned her back on me and started typing an email on her desktop. I thought she was giving me some time to think but when I had a solution, I tried to let her know by calling out her name. She did not acknowledge! Can you believe it??? I was literally standing behind her for 10 minutes telling her that I have a solution. She did not like my solution so moved onto the next question. While I had different solutions, she had something in mind (Note: She was still typing on her computer faced against me)  At last, when I asked what was the solution to the second question, she was like 'Thats too many lines of code. I cannot explain'.  The rudest interview of my life. After that, it pretty much set the mood for me for the rest of the day. The other interviews were fine and I was really upset.  I even contacted the recruiter and let him know about my feedback but haven't gotten any reply yet. Not even to the result of the interview.   My advice is: I dont know if all of microsoft interview experiences are like this, but we vary of these kind of interviewers.

My first interview was a brief phone screening which was just about me and my projects. I was then invited to join an online group meeting on Microsoft Lync which is similar to Skype, during which a member of HR spoke to all candidates. They discussed the next interview process and answered any questions asked by the candidates (there were about 35 candidates). A date and time was allocated by follow-up email for each of us to attend the interview in the Sydney Office. On my interview day, there was a total of 5 interviewers (all senior members of the Microsoft team), and 5 interviewees. We each received 3-4, 1on1 interviews in separate rooms, rotating between the interviewers. A decision may be made after 3 interviews or you may be given a final 4th interview if needed. I went through a total of 4 interviews, 45 minutes each with 15 minute break in-between. The breaks were spent with the other candidates and a member of the HR who discussed about Microsoft’s work and workplace. The interviews generally went like so: First 5-15 minutes: • The interviewer introduces themselves and their job. • Asks about you, your projects and your past work (basically your resume). Next 25-35 minutes: • Interviewer gives you 1-2 problems, you are to provide your implementation on the white board. • Interviewer asks you to give test cases to your implementation. Final 5 minutes: • Any questions you may have for the interviewer. My Interview Questions: 1. Write a function to determine if a string is a Palindrome 2.     a. Give a list of expected functionality for the “Linked List” data structure     b. Write a function to reverse a Linked List 3.     a. Write a function to determine if a number is prime.     b. Write a function to reverse an integer (i.e. 123 = 321), with O(1) space complexity.     c. Write a function to round a float to the nearest integer (i.e. 3.14 = 3, 3.56 = 4). 4. Write a function to print all paths of a binary tree to a certain depth/length. Example, Input: The following binary tree, searching to a depth of 3       5      / \   3 7  / \ / \ 1 2 5 8 Output: 5-3-1 5-3-2 5-7-5 5-7-8

I communicated via email with an interview scheduler to fly out to Redmond. I had already passed the first round at an on-campus interview, so the on-site interview was scheduled within a couple of weeks. For the actual interview day, it started with the HR rep asking basic questions to make sure you fit the position at all, and then she directed me to my first interviewer. The interviewers would then take you to the next one in your schedule, and they would talk about you to each other in between. FYI, if you're honest to your HR rep about any concerns you might have about the position, the other interviewers will see them and do their best to persuade you otherwise. The interview questions were not as bad as I worried - the questions were very reasonable and could definitely be done in the interview time. There were some things that they asked me about that I freely admitted to not knowing, and then they'd give me a question about it and see if I could figure things out without the prior knowledge. I definitely got the impression that for fresh out of college hires, they don't expect comprehensive knowledge of anything, just raw talent and an ability to think through things. Just be relaxed and enthusiastic and connect to the interviewers. The interviewers were all very friendly and genuinely enthusiastic about their work, and by the last interview they were very clear that they liked me. I received the offer the next day.

Had an on campus interview where the interviewer asked some questions about a couple of things on my resume as well as the most challenging technical problem I've faced and how I solved it. I was not asked any coding questions. Two months went by before I heard anything back from Microsoft and I was led to believe that I had been rejected since several candidates had received an invitation to interview onsite in Redmond, WA. Eventually, my recruiter told me that I had been selected to interview for an SDET role although he didn't tell me on which team (this is only communicated to you on the day of the interview). From this point on, it took another month-and-a-half or so to schedule the onsite interview in Redmond. From this point on though, the process was smooth sailing and I received an e-mail asking to confirm travel details. The trip and itinerary was booked swiftly. On the day of the interview, I met with the onsite recruiter who told me which team I would be interviewing for as well as answered some soft/HR-type questions. I was given some suggestions/advice from the recruiter on how to approach the technical portion of the interview. I had a day worth of onsite interviews with mostly technical questions. We went a bit overtime although I found that each interviewer was friendly and very proud of the work they were doing. They were also more than happy to answer any questions that I had as well as give feedback on my performance on the interview. The format of the interviews was a brief introduction followed by two technical questions. The first was generally on how to test a particular piece of software and the second was usually a whiteboard coding question. After 5 interviews, I met the Hiring Manager who I feel was evaluating my 'fit' for the organization. The questions here were a mixture of technical/non-technical ones. ADVICE: - Although it has probably been stated elsewhere, I cannot stress the importance of knowing the following things:     - Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, etc.) as well as how the various operations on those data structures work     - Being Able to Reason Time Complexity in code that you've written/seen (especially operations on data structures)     - Coding on a whiteboard/without a debugger - I would also suggest going on the internet and getting some practice with coding problems (TopCoder, CodeKata, HackerRank, Leetcode, etc. etc. etc.)

Given a binary tree, how would you set the keys/values of all the nodes and their child pointers to null. No language restriction.

Phone screening for software research. Mostly background stuff with one technical question. I was asked to create a function to check if a binary tree is sorted. I used a recursive solution that, at first, failed in some cases. The interviewer pointed that out there was a bug, I found the problem and devised a different solution. My second solution was correct but the interviewer disagreed. Told her I couldn't find the bug she was referring to, and that I'd email her with a correction as soon as I did. After some research and consideration, it turned out I was correct, so a weird process overall. Didn't get an offer.

Interview 1 1) You have a c style string containing some spaces. Move the spaces to the starting of the string. Do it in place in one iteration. 2) You have a bit pattern and an infinite stream of bits coming in. You need to raise an alarm whenever the given pattern comes. Storing the stream is not allowed. Interview 2 1) You have an array of size N. Implement a queue using this. 2) A sorted array has been rotated. You need to find out the point of inflexion, i.e the position at which the smallest element of the array is present.(I did this in log n time)     For example if the array is [6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5], the output should be 4 Interview 3 1) You have a BST and int value(take it to be variable val). You need to print our all possible paths in the BST which sum to val, they may or may not start at the root. 2) You are given a dictionary and two strings a and b. You need to convert the string a to b such that only one alphabet is changed at a time and after each change the transformed string is in the dictionary. You need to do this in the minimum number of transformations. For example the transformation from cat-->boy can be done as follows      cat-->bat-->bot-->boy (if dictionary has bat and bot) Interview 4 1) You gave been given a tree(not binary, it can have any number of children) in an array. The ith entry of the array is the parent of the ith node. For the root node this entry is -1. You need to find the height of this tree(O(n) soln was asked for). For example the array [2,6,3,6,3,6,-1] represents the tree below. The height of the tree is 4(the path from 6 to 0)                                                   6                                                   / | \                                                   1 3 5                                                   / \                                                   2 4                                                   /                                                   0

You are given an array of numbers. You need to print the length of the maximum continuous sequence that you encounter. For example if input is [3,8,10,1,9,6,5,7,2 ], the continuous sequences are{1,2,3} and {5,6,7,8,9,10} the latter is the longest one so the answer becomes 6.

For example structure the testing process as Snack bar, buttons, coins, dispenser, power control, motor etc. 7. How would you go with automation. Which testing you would automate and which you would do manually. 8. It is a coding question: Given 2 strings write a program to find if they are anagrams are not. For example: abc and bca are 2 strings then it should return true because both strings have same length and also all the characters match each other. The count of the characters should also be same. 9. Test the above code with different types of tests. 10. The interviewer suggested to ask any questions about their team. Later I got call from the recruiter saying they are interested in conducting a full-loop interviews. Here are the interview details 1. Implement maze functionality (Mouse should move and eat the cheese) with the following functions • Step: Moves the mouse 1 step ahead • Rotate: It will rotate the mouse 90 degrees. • IsDotWall: Will return true or false based on if the wall is there. • Is.Cheese: This needs to be called when you find out that cheese is there. It will basically exit the program. 2. Test GoTo dialog box in one of the microsoft internal applications. 3. The developer gave a small function Public static double (string str) { //code Return double; } Test the above thinking it as black box testing. 4. Already there is a previous version of the toaster.

Initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. Approximately two weeks later I was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on-campus interview (i.e., first round). The campus interview was with someone who wasn't a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. This interview lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. We mostly talked about items on my resume, whether or not I faced any unique challenges and if so, how I overcame them. This was a very conventional interview. Upon the conclusion, I was asked a technical question. About three weeks later, I was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if I was available to fly out to Redmond, WA for the second round interview. I had a very compact window to interview within, and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints. On interview day, the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on-site, who will discuss the group / team you will be interviewing with, and answer any other questions you may have at the time. This recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results, and work further with you should you get an offer. After meeting the recruiter, you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. Mine were all in the same building. Next you meet with 3-5 interviewers, and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. You are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one, presumably so they can confirm / deny a weakness. For me, the first interviewer didn't want to talk about my resume at all. He was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. Some non-technical questions were: "What would you change about Windows?", "What do you read to stay on top of the latest technology?", "What are some examples of trending applications?". Then he went to the coding problems. One a mathematical proof, and the second more coding oriented. The next interview was over lunch, and this interviewer asked me initially about my research, but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. After lunch we went back to his office and I was asked another coding problem. The third interview was more theoretical. The interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting, and then we went into an open-ended math / optimization problem. After the third interview, I was told that I would not be seeing the fourth interviewer (this means you failed), and I was taken back to HR to discuss the day with the recruiter. I should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit. Overall, the interview was very challenging. You absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. The second round is not about what you have done, but rather what you can do now, in a high-pressure situation. Also, you are told that you can code in any language, but in reality, you need to be able to code in C/C#. Not being familiar with either, I tried to use Python so as to not get bogged down in syntax, but it was generally not well received.

On Campus / First Round 1) Write a function that returns the indexes of a character in a string Second Round 1) Prove that for a set of numbers that are {prime -> non-prime -> prime} (ex. 11, 12, 13) the non-prime number is always divisible by six. 2) Write a class that adds or removes data from a queue 3) Write a class that can store and interpret large integers (i.e., numbers that cannot be stored as an int). The class must be able to perform mathematical operations on the represented data. 4) You are an owner of a building, which has a broken revolving door. What time do you replace the door?   1 Answer

30-minute college technical screen (programming problem, test cases for it, and some basic behavioral questions), followed by 5 one hour rounds in Redmond. First two rounds with individual contributors, last three with managers with increasing level of seniority. Most rounds were in the format of solving one or two problems on the board and then writing test cases for them, except for the last round with a senior manager who also had non-technical conversation determining my fit with the company. Occasionally there was enough time left to discuss some of my projects or interests - especially during the lunch interview where this sort of conversation is particularly appropriate. Overall a very pleasant interview experience which I was expecting from Microsoft based on reading other reviews.

I did not get any particularly challenging algorithms/data structures questions, but one problem had a constant-time solution that was not immediately obvious. So before jumping in think whether there could be a trick that trivializes the problem.   Answer Question

As a returning intern I was

Most of the technical questions, I felt very prepared for. The most difficult questions were behavioral. In particular, "Tell me about an experience where a project partner enjoyed working with you." Rather than talking about your skills you have to talk about how you worked well with others in a way that they enjoyed working with you, and do so without coming off as being arrogant. Also, they didn't ask the question directly, but came to it in a way that put you on the back foot. The question immediately before was to tell them about a time that you had difficulty working with a partner, and also about a time that a partner had difficulty working with you.   1 Answer

Although I did not get a job offer, overall it was a nice experience. Now here, I have to nullify a myth. They say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager, then you'd get a job. NOPE. NEVER. I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I got rejected. Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews: 1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems. 2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string. 3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction. 4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer... 5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years. Very cool, very smart and very fun, It could be easily observed by the flags/decoration in the room/some wine on the table in his room!!! By the way, I didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. So this time, he just started chatting with me which I guess was the behavioral part of the interview. Talking about everything except work, about big corporations, hacking!! and so on. It was truly an amazing experience with that person. Based on the book, I surely have gotten the job, but ....One week later, I got rejected.

Then, a Microsoft Shuttle took me to building 36, when Office is developed and I did 4 interviews of about 1 hour each, plus the "lunch" interview which consists in having lunch with one of your interviewers and mainly speaking about what you like to do (favorite programming languages, IDEs and things like that).

It was an easy one: behavioral questions, really high-level technical questions, background, etc. Nice per on from HR. About a week after that I received another email from my university recruiter about the second round phone interview (3 hours). This time, I talked with three different people. Most of the questions were technical, although every one of them asked questions about my background and previous works. In this round, I had to write some code via an online service that Microsoft uses for phone interviews. All of the interviewers were very polite and nice. At the end of each part I was able to ask them what they liked/disliked about Microsoft and especially their jobs at Microsoft. We also talked a little bit about the culture at Microsoft.

The interview was non-technical; he only asked about my previous work and which of the three internship types I was considering. One week later I was invited to fly down to Redmond. Microsoft paid for the flights, sightseeing expenses, and a generous amount of food. The onsite interview itself was four rounds. The first round was a standard dynamic programming problem, maximum-sum subarray. The next two rounds were tailored to my expressed interest in machine learning, and involved implementing the k-means algorithm and a predictive progress bar. The final round was with the team lead, who asked a very trivial coding problem and talked more about the position. Previous reviews mentioned receiving an offer on the spot, which worried me when I was let go without a word. I got a phone call five days later with an offer.

An asian girl interviewed me for about a half hour and asked me some basic questions like how I would go about testing a keyboard and given 8 marbles that weigh the same and one that weighs more, find the one that weighs more in 2 weighs with a balance scale. After that I was invited to 4 onsite interviews at their Cambridge office. I was flown out via plane and given a hotel, all expenses covered (food, taxi, etc.). The people were very nice and accommodating, and we talked about my resume, how I would solve and test certain problems, and I ate lunch with one of my interviewers and we talked about how we got into Computer Science and our experiences so far learned and adaptive to being a CS major. Overall I had an extremely fun time interviewing at Microsoft.

The most difficult / unexpected question I was asked was how to optimize an algorithm for removing duplicates from a sorted list beyond O(n). It turns out that the solution was still in O(n), but involved parallelism to improve run-time.   Answer Question

I submitted my resume online. But it was at the end of year (in december) and the HR said they will be contacting me only in jan or Feb as they normally freeze the hiring fr new grads at that time. As said they contacted me in Feb and asked scheduled a time for a phone screening with one of the dev engineers. The phone screening was normal. The person who contacted me was easy to communicate with. He asked about myself, the projects i worked with and what are my interests and what products that interests me and which team I would like to work with in Microsoft. This was to get an overall idea of where your interest lies in and which team would be a fit for you. Followed by it was a simple algorithm question on linked list to delete a node and to do it in optimized way. Have to give out all the corner cases. After nearly two weeks they called me for an onsite interview. And the process was pretty smooth. Every day i used to receive mails from HR of the things that I need to do and about the travel ad stay. And even received a 'best wishes' mail from them prior to the day of interview. On the day of interview, I was interviewed by 5 people. It involves both technical and behavioral questions. Interview was held at cubicles of the respective engineers and managers. First interview was about detailing my resume. He asked about all the projects that was in my resume. So be well prepared. And also asked if I had any conflicts with other people on the course of project work and how I resolved it. Followed by it was white board coding problems. First it was about how i approach the problem and then have to write a code. Asked about time complexity. Second interview was about the projects again. And he asked me particularly about my internship project. And then asked to solve a problem. We discussed the pros and cons of my approach and then asked to write code. Asked for time complexity. For one problem he asked about the downfall for the approach and then asked if i could find a way to resolve it. I gave him the solution and was moved to the third interview. Third interview was lunch interview. I had no clue about the team I am going to interview with before that morning. And that is the policy of Microsoft not to let the candidates know the team they are going to interview with. So you cant research about them. And so lunch interview is all about you talking. Be ready to question and speak. It all about it. How much you are interested in the job and the team and how good are you at communicating. I started with business model of the team, architecture, technologies used, compared with other technologies, competitors, new features. I also commented on the negative aspects of the product and compared with the features of others. But don't stop talking. If you do well with first three interviews then you will be invited for the fourth one. My fourth interview was more about coming up with my data structure for the problem and then solving a given problem and writing an API. Try to start with normal approach and to make it optimized. And speak your thoughts, even if it may be wrong. They are more than willing to help you out if you are struck. Again this one involved the conflicts you encountered and your influence on any project. It need not be something big. Just show them that you have your opinion and you are in a position to voice it. If you get through the fourth interview , you will be invited for fifth one with the dev manager or director of the team. This one is not technical, but purely you interest again. It was again 60 min of interview. And after one day I was informed that I got selected.

Nothing unexpected. But be prepared to talk about the conflicts you faced and how you overcame it. And your interests. You resume.   Answer Question 1. Find an element in a 2D sorted array(sorted row wise and column wise ) in O(n) complexity. 2. Finding common ancestor in BST and Binary tree. 3. Reverse a linked list with and without recursion. The head pointer must also be moved. 4. Code for Boggle game. have to design and write code for both dictionary and board. Time complexity. 5. Design and write code for data structure and API for Battleship game.   Answer Question

Recruiter contacted me via Linkedin and invited me to try for the job at Bing team. I knew that they have planned an interview session in Moscow in a month or two. I sent my CV to recruiter and had no reply. After three weeks I wrote a letter to remind them about me and it had worked, she asked me to resend my CV. After that I received an invitation to the phone screening. I generally had an idea what they can ask me, so I tried to make some preparations for the interview, but as I see now it is not enough to go in recruitment process of that kind any further. The Skype interview was not difficult at the start. My English is not very good, but I understood almost everything. The interviewer quickly asked me about my most complex projects and went to the technical questions. First two of them was very easy, then he asked me to write a code to solve a task on the linked list. I had to write the code right in the Skype.

I had an on-campus screen and didn't feel that I performed very well, especially with the behavioral questions. Nevertheless, I got an email inviting me to interview in Redmond, WA. The day of the interview, I was nervous, but excited and enthused. My optimism and cheer carried me throughout the day. Everyone I met was so nice and genuine, and declined all phone calls and texts to give me their full attention. One of my interviewers gave me a hard time for not understanding his instructions for testing an algorithm I wrote, but I kept a smile on my face, took his criticism, and ended up giving my own good insight on the solution. I solved every problem during the day, although I didn't always get the best solution the first time. I was very thorough in my testing of each algorithm. I was very excited to find out that I would be getting a 4th interview, which was with a manager. The function I had to code during this 4th interview was fairly straightforward. It was also easy to test. Regarding the culture, as I said, everyone was very genuine and attentive. These were all people I would be excited to work with, and I had some pretty good banter with most of them. I got the affirmative interview results soon after. I had a great time in Seattle, and Microsoft of course paid all the expenses.

I would rather not disclose any interview questions. I will say that half the questions I got were very personalized, while the other half are similar to the ones you can find online... Know your algorithms, data structures, and design patterns. My networks, information security, databases, compilers, and finite state automata knowledge came in handy as well.   Answer Question

First of all, they went to my university for a presentation and I gave them my resume. A week later, I was contacted by email about scheduling a phone interview. The phone interview (about 20 minutes) consisted of questions like: - How would you test a keyboard? - What is the difference between threads and processes? - Imagine that you get home and you find out you don't have your keys. What would you do? Then I received an email about my phone interview and the process for an interview at Microsoft started. Microsoft pays for flights, accommodation, taxis and even your food. I was interviewed by four different people. The interviews start with a few questions and at the end the interviewer comes up with a problem and asks you to solve it. Once you present your solution, he asks you to code it on the board. My advice is that you should keep talking and pay attention to the hints the interviewer you give you. If he notices that you're doing something wrong, he'll probably make a comment that you can use in order to find out the problem in your idea / code. After coding, the interviewer will ask you to come up with test cases for your code. He is probably expecting you to come up with many test cases, so think as much as you can about ways to break the code! In the same week after my interview, I received an offer by email and accepted it.

The recruiter contacted me initially with opportunities at Microsoft. I wanted to switch from my current job, so pursued ahead. The recruiter first asked me couple of simple questions on sorting a large list of numbers if limited to a certain range, probability of events and some typical HR questions. I had a skype interview with a test manager, who asked my some questions on Java, Databases and OO concepts. He followed it up with a question to write a method that determines a given tree is a BST. I was then called to an onsite interview. The questions were typical CS fundamentals with a "how will you test this" question at the end, where they go into a lot more detail. Microsoft was very professional in calling me onsite and making all the arrangements. Some of the questions were: Max subsum array Questions on java design patterns and multithreading Elevator design and test Max depth of a BST (iterative) Given a histogram find the rectange with the maximum area

Found the job listing on their website. Applied and heard from them via email. Had a telephone interview (non-technical) and then an on-site (North Carolina) interview. Everyone involved in the process was very young -- there seemed to be very little age-diversity there. The interview process involved a lot of programming and solving logic puzzles at a whiteboard while trying to explain what I was thinking to the interviewer. This made it impossible for me to concentrate on the problem. I felt their interview was useless in that it did not give them any idea of what my skills were and why I would have been a good fit for their position. There were also a lot of communication issues with them -- confusion over the dates and times for the interviews.

Besides the usual silly logic puzzles, one question was "How would you test a whiteboard marker?" Since part of the reason I am good at testing software is that I have developed it, I felt that this question was not usefule -- I know very little about how whiteboard markers are produced.   Answer Question

Contacted by a recruiter after a friend at Microsoft sent my resume around. First a phone interview with the recruiter where she asked simple questions about my current job and then some basic technical questions (what's XAML). I then got a phone screen with a SDET where I was able to ask a little bit more about the job and the team. She then asked me an algorithm question and how to test it. The recruiter contacted me some days later asking me to come for an on-site interview. The interview went from 10AM to 6PM and I met 5 people (at first you're set-up for 3 interviews but if you perform good they tell you that you need to meet someone else). They asked me some algorithm questions and almost no test questions, I got an nice offer two days later.

So altogether the process took roughly 3 months from application to in person interview.

Microsoft came to our campus and I submitted the resume. Was originally scheduled an on-campus interview but it was cancelled by hurricane Sandy. So they had a phone interview. The phone interview was not hard, I was asked to compare two binary trees to see if they are identical, and to design a vendor machine. After two weeks I got an email about further steps, seems like MSFT has a long candidate line so I was scheduled an on-site interview on January. Candidates were gathering in the lobby of building 111 and recruiters came one after another to talk with us. Then we are given the info of interviewers and they had shuttles to take us to different buildings. The interviewers are nice, they tried to be inspiring and helped me through the technical questions. I was sort of unsatisfied about the later interviewing process because after the fourth interviewer, I was sent to the fifth guy and was told that I need to wait for an hour. After waiting in the lobby for 45 mins, the guy showed up and told me that my day was over. I didn't expect that I could get an offer from Microsoft, but keeping ppl waiting and then letting them go is definitely not professional.

My code was surprisingly cleaner than I expected, and that too on paper. Then, he went about describing his role and what his team does. Following this I was asked few HR questions. These questions are basically to gauge your technical aptitude. Was contacted through email about selection for the next round.

First I had an on-campus interview with a recruiter with an easy coding question. A bit later they told me they wanted to fly me out to Redmond for on-site interviews. First I met with a recruiter who told me what the rest of the day was going to be like, then they called a shuttle to take me to another building for the interviews themselves. The first interviewer greeted me in the lobby, took me to the kitchen to offer me a drink, then led me to his office for the first interview. Each interviewer generally started by asking me about myself, asked a coding question, asked me to optimize my solution, asked how I should test my solution, then gave me some time to ask them any questions I had. This took about 45 minutes total per interview. Then they would take me to the kitchen to offer me another drink then pass me off onto the next interviewer. One interviewer in the middle took me to lunch, where we ordered our food and took it to his office to eat during the interview. I think there were 5 interviews total, all with members of the same team. Then I took a shuttle back to the first building, where the recruiter from that morning did a debriefing and sent me on my way. They were all very nice throughout the process, and when I asked them questions, they were very honest in their responses, telling me both the pros and cons of working at Microsoft. The company was also very generous with respect to what they would pay for, especially food.

I was notified the next day that I would be invited onsite. Initially they were insistent that I would have to interview for SDET in Mountain View. However, they quickly budged on this point. I met with 4 interviewers during my onsite interviewers, who were all very nice.

Applied online via website. Got a request for a phone interview about a month later. Phone interview was about 30 minutes and mainly asked like what parts of software you like dealing with (UI, Backend, Application layer etc) and then a test question (how would you test a ____ ) and a small math/logic brainteaser. Got an email about 3 weeks later saying they would like to skip the next round of phone interviews and fly me out to Seattle for final rounds of interviews. Due to the holidays, the process got delayed a bit, but I set up flight/hotel and my day of interviews. The whole trip was excellent, I felt like I was really being taken care of. They will reimburse a generous amount of money for things like food, transportation around the city. They even gave me some taxi vouchers on my interview day so I could explore Seattle and I wouldn't even have to pay, and it would get billed to Microsoft directly. The on-site interview day is a long and challenging day, yet it was still enjoyable. You start out in the recruitment building where all the other candidates will be as well. You'll get individually called out by your recruiter who you meet with first. Then you are taken via Microsoft Connect vehicles to the building in which your team you will be interviewing with works. I had 4 interviews, all technical. Every interview started out with a bit of resume talk, future plans and things about your time at school. Then we did 1 or 2 programming problems each. The technical problems are pretty industry standard, ranging from string manipulation to data structures, to graph theory. Just be sure to talk your way through them with the interviewer. All the interviewers asked even more probing questions to see how much you know about a subject. They asked me all the way down to actually implementing a hashing function when the topic of HashSets came up. But remember, it's okay to admit you don't know at a certain point! They seem pretty agnostic about what language you use, and one interviewer even started the interview by saying that he is not a compiler, and will not care if there are small syntax errors. That was reassuring and put my mind to ease for small things. There is also a lunch interview where you get some a lunch voucher to pay for you and your interviewer's lunch. Very light discussion during lunch, mostly about resume and past projects. After all this, you will meet with your recruiter back at the recruitment building. My interviews went from 10am-5pm. Like previously stated, they gave me some taxi vouchers and I explored Seattle all night before returning to my hotel and catching my flight back the next morning. I can't wait to start!

Initial communication occurs through email. All communication until the trip to Seattle occurs through email. My interview coordinator was very pleasant, helpful, and quick to respond back. Microsoft will take care of the entire process for you (and even get you a rental car if you choose). Once in Seattle, you'll have to visit a designated area (mine was Building 111) at a certain time (mine was 8:30AM). Microsoft will keep you in Seattle for up to 2 nights. Day of interview process is pretty well organized. You'll meet with an interview coordinator (different than the email interview coordinator) and he/she will explain the entire day to you and which team you are interviewing for. I found this person (I may have lucked out) to be very pleasant to work with. Afterwards, he/she will put you in a shuttle to go to your first interview. Microsoft told me I'd be interviewing from 8:30AM - 5:00PM, but I was instructed that I'd be done at 3:00PM. Microsoft will handle all travel to the different interview areas. This depends on your team. I was in one building the whole time. After each interview is completed, you'll be told who you'll interview with next, where, or sometimes they'll just go get him/her for you. I interviewed with 4 people that day on one team. Each interviewer generally started off talking about himself and then began with the questions (except the last one). My last interview was pretty awful. He showed up late, unprepared, hit me with random questions until he was prepared, and then threw a technical question at me. It flustered me a little.

None of the questions were difficult per se. There was 2 object oriented design questions, 2 array-related questions, and 1 binary tree question. I tripped up on the binary tree question (it was with the last interviewer that flustered me up). It's an easy solution. I got it down conceptually, I just had two more lines of code to put in there. The question was -- Find the common ancestor of two given nodes.   1 Answer

I applied online through their website and was contacted for a phone interview. The initial phone interview was with a recruiter and asked both HR questions and technical questions. One question asked was: There are 8 marbles, one is heavier than the rest, and you are allowed to use a balance. How would you find the overweight marble by using the balance as little as possible? (Answer: Measure two groups of three marbles against each other. If they're even, you know one of the remaining two marbles is the overweight one, and can measure once more for a total of two balance uses. If one of the groups of 3 is overweight, then measure one marble from that group against another marble from that group. If they're even, it is the remaining marble that is overweight, otherwise you'll know which marble is overweight from the balance. This gives a total of 2 balance uses to find the overweight marble, which turned out to be the correct answer). Another question I had was how to test a printer. I received an offer to interview on-site in Seattle. I met with the recruiter in the morning who told me the team I was interviewing for, and that I would meet up with her at the end of the day. I had four interviews in total. All asked general HR questions at the beginning. The coding questions I had were: create a function that returns the amount of income I will have from a year's worth of work after taxes given a salary and the tax brackets. I don't remember the others, but they were fairly typical questions I had heard before. Each interviewer asked HR and a coding question.

Like other postings on this site have indicated, the standard hiring process with engineering seems to be one technical phone screen and a day of fun and games on site (provided that the phone screen went well). This was my second interview with Microsoft. Back in 2008, I interviewed for an SDET position for which I received an offer and graciously accepted. I voluntarily left the company 2 years later because I did not enjoy my work as an SDET. Contrary to what the recruiter will tell you, it's quite difficult to move around within the company once you're there. I've found that it's actually much easier to just leave the company and come back on your own terms -- which is pretty much how I did it. Although one piece of advice there: make sure you have a rock star record before leaving because they save that stuff and will review it if you return. This was a bridge that I made absolutely sure *not* to burn on my way out. I was contacted by an MSFT recruiter about an SDE position. I did an initial phone interview with someone. He was quite personable and asked me a lot of questions about things on my resume. There was one particular personal side-project that he thought was interesting and we discussed it at great depth for maybe 45 minutes. The questions didn't feel quizzical, but rather like he was actually interested and engaged in what I had done. Then he asked some basic work related questions around how the file system at my current company works. Next, we did some coding in a shared document. This part wasn't bad. He asked me to insert a node in to a binary search tree (BST) and then balance it. All in all, I wrote the code to insert a node, get current balance of the tree, determine the current height of any node, and the rotate_left and rotate_right functions in the case where a rotation is needed to restore the balance. It was around 120 lines of code give or take. All done in the C programming language. Not bad. The bottom line in any interview is that if it's on your resume, it's fair game. Then they brought me on campus for a full round of interviews. They scheduled me to talk to 4 different folks which were on an itinerary that they gave to me in the lobby when I walked in. What they don't tell you though is that each interviewer is a gate-keeper to the next, so if at any point in time you don't do well, then it's "game over". If, however, you do well, you'll end up finishing the entire schedule, plus doing at 2-3 additional bonus interviews. I went in around 9:30 and left some time after 5. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that you'll receive an offer, but if you're shown the door before you finish (minimally) what's on your schedule, that's probably a bad sign. I went in there with my coding weapons off safety -- but I didn't feel like I was grilled as thoroughly (technically) as I should have been. I was asked a lot of design questions mostly around locking, thread synchronization, and scheduling, data compression and snapshot operations on file systems. All in all, I didn't have any trouble with anything and the interviews felt more like a conversation about the things that I am passionate about. I expected to write more code than they asked me to -- and certainly I was prepared. Each interviewer will make a recommendation to the next on where to focus their attention in an attempt to find a weakness -- similarly, they'll also recommend areas to skip if your skill level in that particular area is already of known (good) quantity. They're constantly probing in different places throughout the day, scanning for a weakness, and if you're strong in something, my observation has been that they will adjust their approach (as opposed to continuing to set'em up and allowing you to knockin'em down). I demolished the first couple of coding problems early on and I think that's why they changed vantage points to a most holistic approach -- they wanted to know if I could see the "big picture". At one point in the day, I even asked for another coding problem at which point, I was politely declined. So then I offered to give them one instead. Again, denied, lol. My day ended sometime between 5pm and 6pm. I can't exactly remember what time it was (perhaps 5:30), but it was dark out (and cold!). Having done it twice now, the one best piece of advice I'd give to anyone is to get a lot of sleep the night before, rather than study. Studying the night before won't save you. :) Regardless of the technical level of difficulty, this process can be quite nerve-racking. Emotionally, it takes its toll and by the end, I was exhausted. They called me three days later and said that they wanted to move forward with an offer.

I posted the questions below. This post is focused on the final onsite interview not the hr or first round interview. I really didn't like the process. I was interviewing for sde but got mostly design questions nothing on data structures and algorithms. If you are good at designing software architectures(the UML+implementation) then you would have aced it. Only 3 interviews for me. Some advice the process is so random, you can get easy interview questions or hard ones. So I think getting hired is mostly based on luck and the focus of the questions they ask you and how experienced the interviewer is. 2 of my interviewers were at microsoft for a long time so they were really cooperative, one guy was pretty new there and wasn't very responsive when I told him my solution. Like I said I applied for sde but all the questions were mostly on design nothing about algorithms. no testing, no time complexity analysis.

Microsoft had stopped by my university (University of Illinois at Chicago) for our career fair, the day before they held a hiring event. I turned my resume into a recruiter and got maybe a minute at most to discuss some things (there were a good 200 people and around 4 recruiters so they were trying to move quick). About two weeks later I got an email saying they'd like to set up an on-site interview. Going into the interview it became apparent that the recruiter had guessed which position to place us in (PM, SDE, or SDET), I was suggested for an SDET position. The first interview was still an overall interview to see which would be a best fit. We discussed basic interview questions like what group projects I had worked on, what I plan to do with my career, why I'd like to work for Microsoft and so on. There was a design question, asking how I'd change the room we were sitting in. There was also a programming question, reversing the characters of words within a string (ex. 'Here is a string' to 'ereh si a gnirts'). I answered both answers going into a lot of detail, but he was impressed with the design question and passed on a recommendation for a PM position. Two weeks later I was contacted saying I was moving on to the next round and they'd contact me to set up a phone interview for a PM position. The phone interview covered most of the same questions as the first interview, but with more of an emphasis on the PM role. The first question was to design a watch, which took roughly 15 minutes to complete going through every possible aspect of it (marketing, target audience, various price builts, build, etc.). Following that was a relatively standard brainteaser. At the very end they asked if I would be interested in the MSIT program. We didn't have much time so I only got a brief description, but I agreed to it and the interview ended. Another two weeks later I get an email saying I was moving onto the final round in Redmond for an SDE/SDET position in the MSIT program. There was a good amount of paperwork but the recruiter I worked with helped me with any issues I had. They picked up the tab for the flight, rental car and hotel, as well as reimbursement for food during my visit. Fast forward another five weeks. Shuttle's were parked outside of my hotel in Bellevue (a town close to Redmond) at 7am to pick up about 20 candidates going to three different locations on campus. Upon arrival we were brought into a really nice lobby and offered food and beverages. From there we were set up with four interviews at 45 minutes a piece. After my first interview I quickly realized that I had made a mistake with my resume. I mentioned that I had worked with relational databases, and I put a little too much emphasis on it. Each interviewer dealt with databases, and three of them focused on just those concepts. For the most part I was able to hold my own, but my second interviewer really grilled me and I definitely fumbled. The questions he asked me were out of my scope. I answered as best as I could, but I asked for more hints than I would have liked. The other two databases interviews were on much broader subjects that I am comfortable with. Another common theme between all of them was testing. All of my questions were followed up instantly with, "alright, now how do we test this?" The immediate response I had was always testing out functionality (which is something I do in my job). The answer they were looking for, and would eventually get out of me, is other concepts like concurrency, CPU/memory usage and exception handling. So with those items in mind, how would we test to make sure we won't run into those issues, or how do we test to see if they are indeed an issue. Asking around between interviews I realized I was one of few that was getting these types of questions. Everyone else had standard fare programming questions, something I had prepared for. I only briefly studied for databases, so learn from my mistake. If it's on your resume, make sure you know it well! Rather than keep us all waiting on campus they shuttled us back to our hotel around 1pm, letting us know we'd hear from them within the next four hours. The next stretch seemed to last for forever. 6pm came and no word, I sent them an email around 7pm to gauge where they were at. Around 10pm I got a text from Michael (the University Staffing Ninja as his email signature suggets) saying he had been busy and I should hear within the hour. About 4 minutes to midnight I got an email stating that I had been given an offer and a follow up call would go over the details. In that respect, they kept their promise that I'd get results the same day. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. It's made clear that even though they dish out a good chunk of change to have you visit Redmond, it's not a guaranteed position. They can tell you have potential, and this is your time to really impress your potential teammates.

Had a on-campus interview first. Then, went to on site interview. There were 4 interviewers in total. Everything was fine until I met the 3rd interviewer.

I was interviewed as an intern for 30 minutes and was asked about my education history and 2 algorithm questions. The interview was scheduled by my recruitment helpers at the University of British Columbia, Canada. A cover letter and resume were submitted for when I applied to Microsoft. Prior to the interview, you are asked to fill out a form about what domains interest you and what type of position you would prefer (program manager, software development engineer, software development engineer in test). After my internship was over, they offered me a full time position. No further interview was required. I seem to be an exception to the usual case in which a full day interview process is normally required.

It was a very straight forward technical interview, i.e., no behavioral questions were asked at all. My interviewer was SDE II from the Windows 8 phone team.

I got in touch with them by a referral from someone at my University who got a job offer with them. First there was a very simple phone interview in which they asked some pretty varied questions, such as how I would explain the internet to a young kid and how I would test a vending machine. They always finish with a small logic puzzle which are pretty easy and you've probable even worked with if you've been programming for a while. Afterwards, you're supposed to fly to Redmond but they gave me a 50/50 thing, where I would take 2-3 interviews by phone to screen you, and if you pass you fly to Redmond for the last batch. The interviewer by phone asked me some questions about pointers, recursion, and some basic data structures, but he took it as in depth as possible. Definitely brush up on your Data Structures. After this, I got sent to Redmond where I had 2 interviews. One was with someone from MS Office. She was a charming lady who just portrayed peace to me, so it was really nice. She asked me to write a pre-order traversal that worked iteratively instead of recursively. This wasn't bad at all but again: data structures. My next interview was with a guy from server (Azure to be more specific). He asked me to make a Stack, but he took it down to ever little. Since I wanted it do it with a Linked List he asked me to implement a Linked List first and just kept squeezing every little detail out. Afterwards, he asked me to make it thread safe which was very easy. Then he through a trick question at me about how exceptions would make my stack fail...and I didn't get the answer. About 45 mins later a guy from HR took me to a room to tell me that I didn't get the position. He was very cool about it and MS Staff is extremely friendly, which is somewhat bad since it's harder to read how you do. All in all, great experience and I hope to make it next year.

I applied for a summer internship as an SDET with Microsoft before my senior year in college, and after a fairly brief technical phone screen I got asked to interview on site in Redmond. Before I left they sent me a form to select what departments I'd be most interested in working with. I chose anything I would be remotely interested in, and in retrospect I think I spread myself too thin. When I got to Redmond, all of my five interviews were with people who worked on the MSN money website, which, given the choice, is not something I would personally decide to work on. They started with a standard programming questions: implement a function that finds whether a point is inside of a rectangle, and then I had a conceptual puzzle involving a modified calendar. Some of the people I spoke with were friendly, but I also got the impression they were a little insincere, especially when speaking about how much they liked their jobs, and working for Microsoft. I had lunch in the Microsoft food court and it felt very similar to being in college, except the people were maybe ten years older and more predominantly male. It seemed like a high-stress environment, and the recruiter was definitely the warmest, most relaxed person I encountered during my visit.

After that I went to Redmond for full-day on site interview. 4 interviews of 1 hour in length and 1 lunch interview. It was a typical day as explained in other reviews, nothing special. All interviews started with some chat, followed by multiple technical coding questions. No advanced questions at all, I solved all problems using either a hash table or a linked list, nothing fancy.

I applied online for a new grad position. I was contacted for a phone interview shortly after. My phone interview was about 30 minutes long and consisted of no coding questions. There was one brain teaser about measuring water using a couple buckets and the most technical question I was asked was what are the differences between C and C++. From there, I was notified about 10 days later that I would be moving forward to final round interviews for an SDE position in Fargo, ND, and that I would be hearing from a scheduler soon to set up my interview day. 10 days after that the scheduler emailed me about setting up a day to come to Redmond to interview. Then she apologized that she had made a mistake and that I was actually interviewing in Fargo. I provided my availability and then heard nothing for about 3 weeks. By this point, I had already had my onsite interview with Amazon (I applied to both companies at the same time) so I emailed my scheduler to ask if any progress had been made. She said I had a tentative date, and reemphasized 3 times that it was tentative, that would be at the Friday of the following week. She said she would contact me again when the date was closer. Jump ahead one week to Monday. I received an offer from Amazon and still had not had a date confirmed with Microsoft, so I emailed my scheduler to politely inform her that I did not wish to move forward. I got a response almost instantly saying she was "just able" to get my interview confirmed for the upcoming Friday, which gave me 4 days notice, and asked if I still wanted to come out to Fargo. I replied again saying that I wasn't interested. Then I heard from my original recruiter who was basically begging me not to pass on the opportunity to interview and consider Microsoft. She said if location was the issue, she could reschedule me ASAP for an interview in Redmond. So I agreed to fly out to Seattle if they could get it scheduled within the timeframe that I needed to reply to Amazon in. The next email I got was from someone I had not been in contact with yet, saying "I hope you're getting excited for your interviews, blah blah, safe travels!" and I was confused. Was this person referring to my interview that had been confirmed for Fargo, or a new interview in Seattle? I responded asking what was going on and she replied saying "Disregard my email and work with your scheduler to get a date set." It was not until Wednesday evening that I was informed I was interviewing that same Friday in Seattle. I got a call from the travel department trying to set up last minute flights, and flew out the next night. When I arrived for the onsite interview, I sat in a lobby with about 15 other candidates for about 40 minutes waiting for someone to come retrieve me to start my interview day. This someone turned out to be the same person who had emailed me earlier in the week to wish me safe travels before I had an interview confirmed. When we sat down to talk, we discussed the confusion and I tried to put it all out of my mind so we could move forward. Then she says, "So, you're here to interview for an SDET position." Um, what? I was told SDE. There is a difference between the way you interview for a developer and a tester position. She went to double check and then confirmed that yes, I was interviewing for a testing spot then tried to pitch the testing position to me and asked me to keep an open mind, while trying to convince me that the interviews are basically the same for either spot and that the job responsibilities overlap a lot. If you look at Microsoft's website where they have information for preparing for interviews, you can see there is quiet a difference between the two types of interviews. So the rest of my day consisted of 4 interviews with testers. I feel that I answered their coding questions well (none of them seemed very hard) but I was clearly unprepared to answer so many testing questions. I wasted their time and my time making that trip to Seattle. I respect the 4 people I interviewed with and learned a lot about Microsoft's SDET role from, and I feel like a jerk for coming in without having done much prep in the testing arena. At the end of the day, my interviewer said she figured out what had happened. Regardless of the reason, someone should have communicated to me that I was interviewing for test rather than dev BEFORE I showed up for the interview. And she said that she had emailed and asked the interviewers to consider me for both SDE and SDET after the day had started. I don't know how many of them got the memo or how a testing team is supposed to say, yeah, give her an offer for some other team who has never met her, but either way I was notified the following Monday that I was not going to receive an offer. Quelle surprise!

Half the questions were unexpected because I didn't expect to be interviewed for an SDET position.   Answer Question

Started out by applying online on a saturday. Got an email from the recruiter wanting to chat by Monday. We set up an time a couple of days later where I was asked some basic object oriented programming questions like access modifiers etc. Got an email two days later to set up tech screen with one of the senior SDETs. I scheduled it a week out to give me time to study. I didn't think I did so great but got an email saying they would like to move forward with on-site! Yay!!!!! Went on-site and from most interview stories, I knew that if I didn't make it past No 3 interviewer, I was screwed. I was so nervous as we ended the 3rd interview and at the end he said "Someone else would like to meet you" I did a dance when he turned his back!! The first 3 interviews were technical in nature; 60 mins each except the lunch interview which was 90 mins. I must say that Msoft has the best interview process. The interviewers were nice, cordial and really trying to help me succeed unlike some of the other tech company interviews I have been to. They also had senior people interview me so I guess having experienced interviewers makes a diff. After the 4th interview with the hiring manager, I met another senior engineer from a different team who was there to validate all that the other interviewers had said. I was sure this was the last then I was told I was to meet one more person! The hiring manager's manager! I was burnt out at this point. One look at my face and he said "Its obviously been a long day, I won't keep you for long". I was relieved to hear that. From the 5th interview, it was all general chatting about school I graduated from, behavioral questions, how many apps on my phone, passions and so on. In all I had 7 interviews including the recruiters'. My day started at 9.45am and ended at 5pm. It was well worth it cos I got the offer the next business day!!! I'm sooooo excited!!!! Goodluck to everyone trying to get in. Just keep working at it and don't give up. I have been rejected at Amazon, Google, Facebook and on my first try with Microsoft I got it!!!

The interview process is somewhat unpredictable. There are multiple interviews, typically between three and five. The interviews themselves have somewhat unpredictable content. Some teams leave it up to the individual interviewer to determine what to ask. At the other end of the spectrum, some teams determine in advance what they want to assess and which interviewers will cover each area. Some interviewers give algorithm and coding questions, others do just an algorithm or a coding question. Some interviewers ask for past demonstrations of particular social skills.

Recruiter visited my school and was accepting resumes. Decided to attend at the last minute and sort of just threw a resume together. A bunch of friends heard back and I was sure I had been denied, till a few days later I received an email asking me to schedule a phone interview. Phone interview was pretty basic, only 1 simple testing related problem. Rest of questions were more to gain a sense of my background and skills. Within a day of the phone interview I got an email saying I had bee recommended for a onsite interview. Lots of emails to book the trip, hotel, etc. A few days before interview, received an email saying the business division I was interviewing for. Flew down to Redmond (Microsoft covers everything and gives a ton of resources to ensure a pleasant visit). Interview day they pick you up from the hotel and take you to the building where your division is located. You spend most of the day in a room with a lot of other interns. There's 4 interviews, each 45 minutes. At each interview time an army of interviewers show up, one assigned for each candidate. During the interviews you are usually asked a question about yourself, followed by coding, followed by test cases. Within 24 hours received the results.

First interview was 30 minutes at my university campus. There was no coding, but lots of technical questions. I was asked for details, descriptions, and outside-the-box thinking on subjects like debugging, agile development, and memory leaks/memory management. There was also the usual fluff, questions about my internship and project experience outside of school. About one month later I had four, one hour interviews. These were coding questions, one-on-one, with current engineers. The interviewers were very helpful and friendly, and obviously very intelligent. Questions revolved around binary tree traversals, merging linked lists, system design and testing -- it's worth noting that every question has at least one "trick" to it, so that it's not trivial. Everyone I came in contact with was extremely helpful, nice and prompt. From recruiters to engineers, they all seem to love their job, but they're also honest enough to talk about what they don't like about Microsoft.

Altogether there were three interview rounds that lapsed a span of 1 month. Round 1 was a 30 minute phone interview that consisted of multiple HR questions and two logic questions. The HR questions were basically me talking about my past projects and difficult problems I encountered and how I overcame them. The logic problems are as follows: 1. Someone codes and interface that consists of 3 input text boxes and a start button. When the start button is pressed a triangle will be drawn on the screen. Each side of the triangle will correspond to a length in one of the input boxes. How would you test this program? 2. You are in a room by yourself and someone walks into the room, asks you to find the temperature, and leaves. How would you find the temperature in the room without leaving the room? Round 2. So after waiting my 2 weeks for the results I made it past the first round. Because Microsoft does not visit my area (Southern Ontario, Canada) to recruit, my second interview was another phone interview. This one however consisted of a 1 hour HR phone interview followed by a 1 hour break then a 1 hour Technical interview. The first hour I spoke with a PM and he asked me a few questions about myself and about situations and my resume. Pretty standard HR interview. The second interview was definitely the MOST challenging of all the coding questions. Question: We have a quadtree algorithm and we are assuming that the boxes are labeled 0 (top left), 1 (top right), 2 (bottom left), 3 (bottom right) 'n' times. Write a function that when given an array input of n size (ie. [0,0,0,0] or [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] would be the top left corner) would determine if the corresponding box has at least one side touching at least one of the outermost walls. Round 3. So I made it through Phase 2 (much to my excitement/surprise) and the third round was an interview in Redmond, WA on the campus. The interview started at 8am and after talking with the recruiter for a bit consisted of 2 interviews 1h15m each with a 15 minute break in between. Both involved coding and HR questions with only one interviewer. Interview 1: Write a function (in your preferred language C, C++, or Java) that will take the given string and return the reverse. (ie. input:"abc def ghi" output:"ihg fed cba") Optimize the above code (if possible). Now knowing that the original function you wrote in pt1 is being used by other programs and cannot be modified write another function that when called will utilize the function from pt1 to only reverse the words in the sentence. (ie. input:"abc def ghi" output:"ghi def abc") Test your code. Interview 2: Write a function that when given a string will return the position of the starting point of the largest reoccurring character. (ie. given:"AAABBCCCCD" would return 5 (starting point of C)) Test your code.

I got an on-site interview in Dublin for SDE and SDET internship position. I was invited to this interview after a short interview at my university. I had 3 interviews with 1 SDE team (2 guys) ,1 SDET team (another 2 guys) and 1 Project manager. I got a lot of questions related to: Why do I want to work for Microsoft? Why am I pursuing Computer Science? What am I looking for in technology? They asked me about a recent article I read on Techcrunch. Coding questions were easy: - count the binary 1 digits in a number - given two nodes in a binary tree return their Lowest Common Ancestor - given two strings say if they are anagrams I also had Testing questions before every coding question on how would I test a method that does the code.

At the third interview I was asked which one of the previous interviews I liked better and why?   Answer Question You have a project and you want to release it in multiple languages. For every language you have a resource file which contains hotkeys of every Module. For example: one module is File which has Find with hotkey F and Free with hotkey F and another module Edit which has Replace with hotkey R. For every module you want to find the colliding Hotkeys. In our example in module File: Find and Free have colliding hotkey "F". In the resource file a hotkey is coded as:  \alpha"F"Find.Files; where \alpha is one character: alpha. You have 100 languages and around 6000 hotkeys in a resource file. Determine all the colliding hotkeys.   1 Answer

I was informed to go to an onsite interview in Redmond after a 3 hours phone interview. I went through two interviews on the main campus of Microsoft, each lasted 75 minutes. I was asked 2 general coding questions along with some behavioral questions regarding my resume and I am sure that I did it well. But after that, the interviewer from the Bing team asked me to build index for large scale spatial database which may use some special data structure like R-tree, KD-tree or Quad-tree, etc. I did not go over those structures and didn't do well on that. Finally, I did not get an offer.

This was a college campus interview process. Microsoft makes it a point to hire bigtime from colleges. They had a booth in career fair and I submitted my resume there. I was shortlisted for an interview in college. This was just a screening interview and interviewer just asked about some of the interesting problems that I have solved. We dived into some technical details and in the end of this 40 minute interview, he told me to wait for further communication. It was all very quick and they called me for an insite interview in Redmond. It consisted of meeting with 5 people on the day of the main interview, and each meeting was around 1 hr. It involved coding, algorithms, and analytical questions. Overall, the interview process was a positive one. Great treatment and very professional process.

One of the difficult question was about solving a puzzle with good algorithm and coding it up as well. I don't recall the puzzle's name now, but the solution involved using linked list (circular), and writing some classes and methods. In the end, testing was also required for this solution.   Answer Question

When I applied to them, it turned out they were planning to have a campus recruiting event in my city (Moscow) within next 2 weeks, though unfortunately I was on a trip at that time so couldn't make it. Thus they made one phone interview (with a recruiter) and invited me to a recruiting event in Kiev six weeks later. There they had two groups of interviewees coming at different times, each group consisting of 6 people. Every person would undergo 3 or 4 interviews (each 45-minutes long). After every interview interviewers exchange some feedback and you listen to the HR guy who promotes Seattle as a place to live. After that you go to another interview. After 3 interviews they analyse the feedback and decide who stays for another interview. If you aren't invited to the fourth interview, that doesn't mean you wouldn't get an offer. I personally got an offer after only 3. The questions vary in difficulty depending on your interviewer, but overall I found them harder than in other major companies (Google, Facebook). As usually, if you have ever participated in programming competitions, you have better chances of solving their problems.

I don't think I can disclose the exact question, but one of the interviewers actually asked two questions, one of then being some kind of "real world" open-ended one, and another one seemed to be algorithmic, the problem was that there was no solution, and even the interviewer had some ideas about it but not the complete solution.   1 Answer

On campus interview with a project manager. Talked about his experience moving from sales to software development to project management, asked typical interview questions (hardest project, teamwork problems you've had, etc.) No technical questions, although it seems like this changes from place to place. The interviewer indicated that he was not the one who decided on an outcome, but there's no way to tell for sure.

Nothing difficult, just typical interview questions. If you're good at interviewing, you'll get past this part, if you aren't, then you won't. It doesn't seem like they looked at resumes / experience very much. I was expecting at least one technical question, but there were none.   Answer Question

1-hour technical phone screen 8-hour on-site technical interview (including with hiring-manager) After this round I was told by a recruiter that although the team generally thought I was competent, they didn't unanimously feel I was the right fit for this team. This was probably accurate since I didn't ask many insightful questions about the team during the on-site. So, the recruiter forwarded my resume to a few other teams... and I began the entire process again. 2x 1-hour technical phone screen (with 2 different teams) 1-hour in-person technical screen 2x 6-hour on-site interviews In all honesty, I found both of these teams to be more interesting.

The interviewer proceeded to ask questions about if I were the security lead for Facebook what I would do to protect their customers.

He asked me how to reverse a string in C. I was a bit rusty, and the answer he was looking for was to iterate over the length of the string store one character in a temporary character, then store the end of the array in the new location. char&lt;-str[i] str[i++]&lt;-str[end] str[end--]&lt;-char Something like that in pseudocode.   Answer Question

I have not pursued Microsoft further as a result, and instead received offers from other major tech companies (Amazon, Google, etc).

I first received an tentative invitation from a Microsoft recruiter to attend a "hiring event." Several days later, I had a technical phone interview with an engineer with a very heavy accent. Apparently I passed because I was given a formal invitation to the hiring event in Redmond. Microsoft paid for my airfare, car rental and hotel. I arrived at Microsoft early to find the doors locked. Other interviewees and I stood outside until another interviewee, who happened to be already inside, opened the door for us. We slowly met the Microsoft recruiting staff. With one bright exception, they were dressed like slobs and had few answers. It was only then I learned the group with whom I would be interviewing--it was a group in which I had no interest. I would have rejected the interview outright had I known this information from the beginning. I seriously considered walking out. The dozen of us were each ushered into small, very nice, interview rooms with a table, two chairs and a white board. We all had four, 45 minute, interviews with a 15 minute break between. This bothered me because I'd been led to believe that this was a whole day event and had made my schedule with this in mind. It was very obvious that the first hiring manager had already made up his mind. He was a bit rude. He would ask questions and then try to interrupt me mid-sentence. When I didn't let him, he got upset. I don't remember his technical question, but it was absurd. The next two interviews were interesting, though the third of the day was entirely about solving a problem with no other questions asked. I thought them extremely pointless. The last interview was the one of the most interesting in my career. The manager was a fascinating man and spent his entire time asking me pointed questions in an attempt to see where I would fit in his organization. He explained what various teams did and made it clear that he didn't know where I would fit due to my skill set and experience--something I was wondering about myself. The questions helped me form my greatest skill in a different way, which I found very useful. All-in-all, I found the process frustrating, pointless and offensive. I failed to see how all but the last manager could determine anything. I found that the hiring staff and one hiring manager to be very unprofessional. Above all, they acted like I was dying to work there. I was made to feel like a cog in a wheel and had no doubt that is what it would be like to be a Microsoft employee (that may not be true, but is how I was made to feel.) To top it all off, despite reassurances otherwise, I wasn't told the results of my interview until I contacted the recruiter. His response was curt and entirely unhelpful. I should add that I've never been to the Seattle area and found that I didn't like it. The traffic, especially bad.

I was asked about the most challenging project in my past experience. I talked about one project I accomplished, but I supplemented (which I really shouldn't have done so) an unsuccessful research project which I didn't put on the resume. That project was too hard for me to finish in a few months, so I eventually abandoned it. It is not uncommon that a research-oriented project fails in the end, but the interviewer might think you are a loser.   1 Answer

There were basically three steps in hiring 1) Online Aptitude test 2) Subjective test 3) Technical Interview. First two steps are a piece of cake. All questions in first two step are simple and with a little knowledge of Data structures anyone can answer it. Technical interviews were a bit tricky. Compared to all other companies technical interview Microsoft is the easiest (Believe me!). They ask simple questions related to linked list, trees but are tricky. They don't concentrate much on theory questions like explain Dikjstra algorithm... One good thing about Microsoft is you are allowed to give one bad interview. So, if you screw up once, don't worry you might get another chance.

I applied for Microsoft through a university job fair and received an email about scheduling an interview. I went to an on-campus interview with a Microsoft employee, who was not human resources but was a software engineer and tested me out on minor programming tasks and asked me questions about my experience. There weren't any trick questions and the interview was very conversational and not as intimidating as others.

The most difficult question was simply: name an issue and how you resolved it. I was prepared for any programming question they could throw at me, but this one was more difficult. I was fortunate to have a lot of experience developing software in a team environment so I was able to answer this one pretty easily.   Answer Question

5 rounds of interview, 4 technical and 1 HR The first 2 rounds of interview are conducted through internet having MCQs and Coding. The next 2 are personal interviews where the ask technical questions with a high level of difficulty. Some questions can be really tricky which check your aptitude and reasoning power while others check your technical knowledge. The last round is HR

Coding questions can be really difficult and time consuming related mostly to data structures. The MCQs are mostly related to Math and and logical reasoning   Answer Question

Typical interview process at Microsoft Ireland is the following: - CV screening / filtering (my guess is that 90% of applications are rejected at this stage) - coding puzzle (solution to be sent in 1 hour) - initial phone screen (HR + simple technical questions) - 1 or 2 technical phone interviews (engineers) - on site interview Somehow I didn't have to do the first coding puzzle. Likely it was because I was recommended by other Microsoft employee (based in US), so they assumed that I am applying for the job in US. When clarified, they passed my CV to Irish recruiters which moved me directly to phone screening. Probably it's the best to get recommended, so you can skip some initial filters. Phone screens were quite typical: - short technical questions covering OOP, programming languages, databases, networks (5-10 mins) - design question (15 mins) - coding question (typically related to the design from previous step - 20 mins) - discussion of coding solution (how to improve it, how to test it, what are the test methodologies - 10 mins) - Q&A (now you can ask questions) On site interview consisted of four 1:1 interviews (45 mins each + 15 min break) with multiple engineers. Some focus on design skills, some on coding (on the whiteboard), some on testing. Everybody asks some short random questions about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, network protocols etc. The last hour (only 2 out of 10 people got there when I was interviewed) was with a director of the department to which I was applying. It was really hard! I was asked about network protocols, data structures, got an algorithmic problem to solve (similar to "egg dropping problem"), where I had to figure out the optimal (not any!) algorithm and provide a formal mathematics proof of it's complexity (big O notation).

The last 1 hour interview on site was the most difficult (described in the interview process above).   Answer Question

Becides general questions about what I was resposible for at my previous/current jobs, there were few technical questions. Basically, interviewer was usually fine wihout getting too much into the details when I was answerting them.

Contacted by a recruiter, followed up with a phone interview. An in-person interview was then set up; the setup process for the flight was somewhat bureaucratic, but the interview itself went smoothly. While the technical questions were good, I found the interviewers' description of the company to be misleading and portrayed it as being far less competitive and bureaucratic and far more flexible than it actually is. If this is a concern for you I would heavily recommend discussing it with people you can trust and who have experience with other companies.

Questions were mainly related to my past experience, OS concepts, synchronization issues, and so forth. There was less emphasis on algorithms and more on architecture.   Answer Question

A couple of recruiters came to our school last winter looking for a few candidates. Had an initial screen that was easy as hell. Basically all HR questions. This kind of dodged the phone screens. Got called for an on-site interview after a month and flew to Seattle, WA to interview in their Redmond HQ. The on-site interview consisted of 4 interviews that were 1 hour each. They were technically taxing from start to end. Most of the questions (which I don't really remember now) were not seen/heard of by me. Most involved coding on the whiteboard. I took the algorithm first, code later approach. Most topics dealt with data structures, algorithms and some logical thinking (I got to design/code the initial moves in Checkers).

I was recruited at college and had a quick one-on-one screen before being sent off to the Redmond campus for a full-day of interviews. I interviewed with four different people at the same division (Microsoft Advertising). I had on average two questions per interviewer. The questions weren't particularly difficult -- you could tell they were not actively trying to weed out candidates. That said, they were somewhat tricky and required some thought behind them. They were abstract questions that most students studying CS should be familiar with (write a program that finds the most frequent word that appeared in a long string, write a program that finds the shortest distance between two nodes on a tree). Because I was interviewing for an SDET position, it was prudent to show that you thought about edge cases and ways to test your program once you designed it. After my interviews, I was taken back to their college recruiting building and given a briefing. I was not offered an internship on the spot, but they got back to me relatively quickly, after a weekend.

They flew me in for a full day interview. I was greeted in the morning by HR and shuttled off to meet the folks I'd be working with for interviews. It started well but went downhill. They were very aggressive with the questions they asked and how they went about it. I like to think through my answers verbally -- but anytime I said something they didn't like, they would derail my train of thought picking away at it, making it difficult to approach things systematically. Overall, the technical questions weren't that difficult, but their style of interview made it difficult and somewhat unpleasant.

A recruiter reached me via linkedin and scheduled a f2f interview two days later in a hotel. Had five rounds of technical discussion (each 1 hour) and they told there may be one more round (may be technical). 1week later they scheduled a video call with a director (but it was actually an audio only with screen sharing). We talked about some design level ideas then he asked a technical question. I was running into trouble to setup the video call because I'd a mac (hope you understand because the video call tool was developed by MS).

Imagine there are n cities (say c1, c2....cn) connected circularly and each of them has a petrol bunk (say p1,p2...pn). The distance between each cities are d1, d2...dn. Here 1unit of petrol will be used to travel 1unit of distance. You can start from any city so that you can go through all of them and reach the same location (city). Find from where we've to begin the navigation. FOR EXAMPLE: c1--&gt;c2--&gt;c3--&gt;c1 p1 has 2ltr p2 has 10ltr p3 has 4ltr and the distance between each cities: c1&lt;--&gt;c2: 3 c2&lt;--&gt;c3: 2 c3&lt;--&gt;c1: 8 Here we've to start at c2 in-order to come back again to the same place. Explain the logic to find whether u can come back to the same location. Find where to start. Write a program for the same. Write test cases for the same.   1 Answer You're converting a string (s1) into another (s2) by changing the characters in s1. You can do add/delete/replace the characters of s1 to get s2. The cost of any of those operation for a character is 1. Find the minimum cost to convert s1 into s2. Write program and test cases for the same. For example: Convert "Hi" into "Hey". This would require minimum two cost. 1. Replace 'i' with 'e' in s1 2. Add 'y' to s1. Now we've s2.   1 Answer Write a program to iterate through a 2D grid in a spiral way. Since I can't attach images here, I'll explain it using an array. Imagine you've a nxm matrix of bytes. you've iterate through it in a spiral way.

Hope its clear now.   1 Answer You've a singly linked list where every node in the list has a field "random" which points to other node in the same list. Write a function to clone this list (create a new copy of the same). Don't use extra space (just the pointer variables are fine).   3 Answers Some other standard questions: 1. Given a BST and a range, print all the numbers that comes in that range. Ex: the function will be something like: print(node * head, int x, int y); It has to print all numbers within the rage x&y 2.

The interview questions were mostly technical and not too difficult, but it was important to know your CS basics, and also to handle corner and test cases. Also, in cases of ambiguity, I asked questions to make sure that I understood the problem (this is important).

They paid to fly me to Washington and changed the flight last minute at my request, very accommodating. The interviews lasted half a day. Mostly they asked about basic computer science ideas and brain teaser type programming questions (e.g. how to find a loop in a linked list).

After an online application, a recruiter will contact you and ask you to fill out a document that imitates an interview. If they are satisfied with what you fill in, they will contact you to arrange a phone interview. This interview is structured in the same way as the first document. After you pass this, they may schedule an on-site interview where you will have 2-4 interviews with different teams that are available. These interviews are also structured similarly as the previous ones.

I had 2 technical rounds followed by a HR followed by another technical round followed by another HR round PERSONAL INTERVIEW (TECHNICAL) Technical Round 1: In this round I was given two puzzles to solve and a simple c++ question but puzzles are pretty hard. They asked me to speakout whatever idea has come to my mind in order to test the way I approach to solve the puzzle. Technical Round 2:In this round I was asked to write a program which involves concepts from FS,DS and Compute Networks. Little bit clumsy but if we can understand the problem, it is easy to solve. After the completion of the program,he asked me to add some more features to the code and make it more generalized so that any change in the input can be considered in the program.Then I was asked to write the test cases for that particular program. And then some small puzzles. This is the main round because of which I am into Microsoft... :) Technical Round 3:This round is after the first HR round.This is basically to test the patience of a person in writing a code.I was given a pretty easy code but very long. Then I was given two codes and asked to find out the outputs. They are difficult.One who has a good command on basics can easily solve those problems. PERSONAL INTERVIEW (HR) HR rounds are the worst part of my interview.Both the HR rounds are stress rounds HR round 1:I had a tough time convincing the HR about my capability as my CGPA is low. I explained her about my active participation in institute Technical fest and student activities.I have succeeded in my attempt and was forwarded to the next round. She asked me some questions on DBMS and Computer Networks also. HR Round 2:Again I was tortured about my CGPA.I prudently made them accept that CGPA is not the only criteria and I can do better than most of my counter part with a better CGPA if given a chance.This is the main discussion we had in this round.Finally I came out of the interview with flying colors and became pretty sure that I made it to Microsoft. SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCES This is the third company to come. Oracle, Amazon and then Microsoft. I went till the interview rounds in Oracle and Amazon. That in fact gave me a lot of confidence and learning experience which helped me a lot in my Microsoft interview. All the companies which I've faced have same range of technical questions.Do not loose your confidence at any point of time. Being confident is the most important part of an interview SUGGESTIONS TO JUNIORS Do not loose your confidence. CG do matter but it is not the only criteria for selection keep it in mind and prepare accordingly. A proper preparation of 10-15 days is sufficient for a person to get into a good enough company like Microsoft. Try to be good at basics. Never give up for any question. It is very important.Do not keep a company as your dream company because it will made you not to apply for any other company.

It was good that I was eased in to the interview through a phone conversation, talking about expectations and procedures, before I moved on to the next interview. Some interviewers were prepared beforehand, whereas some others seemed to look at my resume the first time when it was their turn to interview. For example, one interview ran out of questions and therefore looked at my resume to ask random questions. Overall, I was asked a fair amount of technical and behavior questions which I felt were accurate enough of who I was as a candidate, and accurately reflected what I know.

I wrote directly to a recruiter, he replied back the same day and he organized a phone interview in 3 days. Phone interview took 45 minutes and consisted of simple questions about C++, multi-threaded development, algorithms and a coding task. I got result the same day that MS is ready for on-site interview with me. On-site interview consisted for 5 interviews, 4 technical and 1 with HR. All interviews took 45 minutes and consisted about general questions and doing some code (first 3) or design (last 1) tasks. If you really want a job at Microsoft, I would recommend you to do some interviews in other companies first, the interview is not hard but you should be prepared.

I first did a phone interview and answered a few basic computer science questions. During the on-site interview, I had around 6 hours of interviews (1 hour interviews per person) throughout the day, including a lunch interview. The "loop" usually gets cut after lunch if you don't make the cut. Fortunately I went the whole day. At the end of the day you usually sit down with someone higher than the hiring manager and discuss non-technical topics so they get a feel for you as a candidate and your potential non-technical contributions to the team.

The interview process I went through is a bit abnormal, since the project I worked on was being bought into Microsoft. I did not need a phone interview. Instead, I went straight to Redmond along with my other team members for on-site interview. It started from 9 to 5, full day including lunches. Each interviewer had me for an hour, and asking me coding questions, design questions, my past experience (especially how well I know the project that was being bought into Microsoft), and the usual. At the end of the interview I was taken to a person who said if I wasn't hired I wouldn't have met him, so I was very happy. A few days later I got an offer that is pretty decent, and so I took the job.

I was contacted by an external recruiter on my LinkedIn account. The job seemed interesting, with their game studio. Supposedly they're working on some kind of super-secret project over there that not even a signed NDA can loose their lips about. But they reassured me this wasn't a games job that generalists were welcomed. Initial phone screen was pleasant, but real tough. We mostly talked about C++, STL containers, 3D game math. To my surprise, I was invited for a F2F. So I brushed up on my game theory, C++, algorithms, data structures, etc etc. On the day of the interview: get up to their location, very nice setup. Was basically grilled for 6 hrs, but not on the subjects I expected. It was mostly questions I'd find typically asked for a game programming job. One linked list question, one for sifting through badly written D3D code, and another was a puzzle question. Basically was given the boot the following Monday. Got the standard corp rejection letter for my trouble. Still, I felt I kicked butt at the interview. I did experience Seattle's LOVELY weather and Friday afternoon getaway rush hour ...NOT! But it shows me yet again, that game jobs that SAY they are looking for non-gamer blood, and do the exact opposite, why I don't pursue game dev jobs as a rule.

I submitted my CV via a Microsoft presentation at my university and got a follow-up email a couple of weeks later. PHONE INTERVIEW: First part of the interview was by phone, and I actually interviewed for a Program Manager position. Initially, the questions were behavioral (i.e. What do you like about programming? What's a problem that you've solved? Illustrate a problem that was solved as a team). The PM technical questions that were asked were mostly logical reasoning (i.e. if you owned a custom shoe store, what questions would you ask the customer in order to ascertain their needs?). I was flown to Sydney about 6 months later for the 2nd round interviews which was for a SDET/SDE internship. 1:1 INTERVIEW Overall, I interviewed with 4 people, roughly 45 mins each. In between interviews, whilst the interviewers discussed the candidates, we (a group of 5) were shown a presentation about Microsoft. Interviews consisted of a behavioural question (i.e. what's a programming project that you've done?) followed by 2-3 technical questions (i.e. given an array of negative and positive numbers, give an algorithm to find the sequence that gives the largest sum. What are some interfaces of a vending machine and how do they interact with each other?). It was concluded by a general 'is there anything you'd like to ask me?'. Prepare questions beforehand! After the 4 interviews, we were told results straightaway. TIPS: - Ask a lot of clarification questions, in order to narrow down the problem. It might help to repeat the question back to the interviewer. - Vocalize everything you do, even if it's something you don't plan on using (e.g. "My first thought is to use an array, but although it has O(1) for retrieval, it can be inefficient as we don't know the number of elements and would potentially need to constantly re-size.") - Admit you don't know something if you're stuck - Show that you're passionate about programming/working at Microsoft Overall it was very positive, the interviewers were very helpful and genuine.

I was referred to MS for a position on a team that was hiring. What happens when you interview there is that you interview with one team, 1:1 interviews all day back to back, with a lunch time interview, and if you are doing well you will meet a VP or other manager at the end of your interview day. Microsoft likes to give you alternatives for what team you want to work for, so you will probably meet a second manager, possibly the day after, to give you an alternative for what team to join. For the lunch interview, we went to Chili's and didn't talk tech. All other interviews were technical in nature, having you solve programming questions on a whiteboard, such as implementing atoi() etc

The process began when I gave my resume to a recruiter at our yearly engineering career fair (in October). She asked me a couple generic questions about my resume ("tell me about this position", "what's something hard you encountered") and why I wanted to work at MS. She took the resume and I got a call a week later about scheduling an on-campus interview. The on-campus interview occurred about a week after, in early November. This interview (and every interview after) had the format of: 5-10 min "tell me about yourself/resume", 30 min technical question, and the rest of the time "do you have any questions for me?" I felt like the interview went well and I was invited to an MS hiring event weekend in December for a day of interviews. When mid-December rolled around, I flew to Seattle and was put up in the Westin Bellevue. The first night, all software and hardware recruits (about 80 of us, for internships & full-time offers) were taken to an event at the Lucky Strike bowling alley where there was lots of good food, an open bar, and bowling. We also got a chance to talk to our recruiters and ask them any questions about the interview process. The next day, we had 4 interviews in a row. One group had interviews in the morning (8 - 12) and the others had theirs in the evening (1 - 5). We found out which group we were in the night before. In addition the morning group had lunch after the interviews and the late group had lunch before. Each group of interviewees met in the same room before the interviews (to eat lunch) and between them. Most people wore business casual attire. The schedule was: interview, 15 minute break, interview, 30 minute video about working at MS, interview, 15 minute break, interview. Interviewers would call us one at a time from the room before the interview, take us to a room to conduct the interview, and then take us back after. At the end of the day, we all went to the same building to play XBOX games and play with the MS surface. Then, our recruiters called us one-by-one to privately tell us if we received the offer or not. I'm glad I got the offer, but the recruiter first quizzed me on how I thought I did and if I had any other offers, and the strong points of my other offers, and how I would feel or what I would do if I did get an offer. I thought that was a little low, since it seemed like she was toying with me and I still didn't know if I had the offer or not at that point. Nonetheless, I was very happy once I got an offer and to hear the terms of the offer, too! I didn't accept on the spot, but my recruiter was hoping I would :P After that, we were taken home in shuttles and free to do what we wanted. I chose to stay an extra night instead of fly home right away and I hung out with some friends in the area. I flew back the next morning. In terms of preparation, I didn't do anything special besides reading the book Programming Interviews Exposed (2nd Ed.) and reading up on interview questions on this site and by Googling (or Binging ;) ). The more you prep, and the more introspective you are about your method of solving a problem, the better. In addition, it's really important to be charismatic and passionate about the position/group you're applying for and to be genuinely interested in finding out if the company is a good fit for you. As cheesy as it sounds, when you have that (and if you prepare ahead of time), then the right job offer will simply present itself.

The whole process was quite thoughful. First met with interviewer one day before interview for questions about the process. Each candidate was assgined with a time slot. Total duration for the interview: half an hour. First introduce previous projects. Then white board coding. Got notification in a week.

Whiteboard programming: given a tile and a word, write a routine to determine if the word is valid. Wild card "*" might be present in tile and can be used for once when there is no match. For example, "bed" is valid given tile "abcdefg". "bread" is valid given tile "abcdefg*".   1 Answer

I got call from some consultancy and scheduled interview on Weenend. Naturally for everybody MICROSOFT is the dream company so for me aswell. Sometimes i felt even if entering into the MICROSOFT campus is suffucient. With that feelings, went to Hyderabad campus and really it is very big and somany buildings. Once i entered into the campus, security check completed then they arranged a car to go to building 2. Once entered into building 2, HR came and brought us into a room and told to wait for some time. After that called for first round. A lady done the first round for me and basic questions asked. Tell me about ur self Explain the OOPS concepts asked SQL Query: there are two tables books(bname,title,author,bid) and author(aname,bid,btitle) and asked to write a query that count of books writen by authors Questions about testing: Unit testing, regression testing, component testing And tools used for Unit tesitng (NUnit, NCover, FXcop) Explain the testing life cycle. What is SLA guidelines that following for different priority of the issues I have qualified the first round and called for second round. Here asked somany general questions related to testing and how to test those? And also questions to test the logic. Write a program for how to remove a partical string in a given sentence ( i thought this is C and tried to written in C but after sometime interviewer asked to written in c# and i have written in c# aswell) asked program for fibonacci series Then asked c# concepts ( collections, generics, serialisation, threading) what is the use of serialization? ( actually i havent prepared for the interview, i forgot the correct answer and told something which is not correct) Given a program by using arrayList and asked whether this will compile successfully or not? and then how to improve. then asked some stupid questions without any clarity. Even queried for many times i am not clear about the questions: how u test that a given line is straight or not? i have answered, by using the x axis value in all the pixels we can say and also if all y axis values are equal. But not sure what if the line is striaght in someother direction How do u get the exact performance when we playing with a dies, if we throw it up and it get backs to our hand like that in a program. This is the question, where we spend somuch time and at any point i was not clear about the question but not sure what is the intension of the interviewer. Finally after second round i was not selected. Actucally just i put my resume in sites and immediately i got call from MICROSOFT. So my suggestion is if we prepared well definitely we can win in the interview. All we have to do is proper preparation and in net we can find asmuch as info for this interview.

Microsoft came to our campus and shortlisted candidates based on the resumes they submitted. They held brief face to face (~30 mins) interviews in campus over 2 days. I was asked about my educational background, my thesis, research and open ended questions such as: 1. Give a few examples of scenarios where distributed computing could be applied and would be useful. 2. Tell me about a time when you were faced with a difficult problem you couldn't solve. 3. Why is finding a bug in a multiprocessor programming harder than in sequential programming? How would you solve this problem? Next they flew me to Redmond for a day full of one on one interviews (5 in total, 4 technical 1 HR in the end). They took care of accommodation, travel, etc and made me feel very comfortable. The people were very nice and friendly.

My first communications with Microsoft were during campus recruiting. I went to their events, but more so because I was interested in the company and their advice for me, not because I had my sights on an internship with them (though I ended up getting one anyway!) I was thrilled/shocked when I found out I had an on campus interview! To prepare, I bought a book called "Cracking the Coding Interview" (It's magical, I'm telling you. I highly recommend it). The day finally arrived! On Campus Interview: Half an hour long. Firstly, the interviewer had Windows 8 on a touchscreen computer, which he let me play with. I asked him some semi-informed questions (I had done a little bit of research on Windows 8 beforehand), which I think he appreciated (example: "The design seems like it's made for a touchscreen, like you have here. Is it still good with a mouse?"). Next, he started with the famed questions! It wasn't hard (especially because I practiced binary tree traversal) - given a binary tree, multiply the value in each node by 2. Once I did that, there was the expected "Ok, now test it". I came up with several test cases, including seeing what would happen if the values were large enough to cause integer overflow once multiplied by two. He said he'd never heard that answer before, which I guarantee was the thing that got me to the second interview. The next question was an object-oriented design question that I had no idea what the answer was, so I was convinced I'd bombed my interview. The next day... I got an email inviting me to a second-round interview in Redmond! I was shocked/humbled/etc. About a month and a half later, I was off to Seattle, convinced that I was dreadfully underprepared. Second Round Interview: If you make it here, LEAVE THE HOTEL EARLY. I got so lost and was barely on time. First thing in the morning: Meet with recruiter. She informed me that I'd be interviewing with the Windows Phone team. (I've never touched a Windows phone, so I figured I was doomed, but it turns out that they're not interested with your experience with specific technologies!) Now, most candidates have a lunch interview, but my interviewer actually forgot to do that, so I was unlucky enough to have 4 (mostly) intense interviews on an empty stomach (he was very ashamed later!). -Interview 1: Hardest of them all, I thought. My interviewer was really intense (really smart - I respected him!) and asked me to implement a linked list. Also, basic object oriented principles -Interview 2: My interviewer found out that I like Project Euler, so he asked me a programming question based on that. Also, he wrote code on the board and asked me to find the bug. -Interview 3: One of the coolest guys I've ever met. He pretty much did a full-blown personality analysis on me (scarily accurate) within the first 5 minutes of meeting me. Then he asked me a brainteaser that I couldn't get the final answer to, but he seemed ok with that. -Interview 4: Finally a non-technical interview! It was with the manager, who told me that my interview was going great (not what I was thinking - so it was a relief!). We talked about life at Microsoft, etc, and then he sent me home. I waited for 2 days (that seemed like eons) to hear back from them. I wasn't confident, but I really wanted to know so that I could move on with my life. The recruiter responded with a short response to my thank you email that said Microsoft wanted to offer me the internship! She then called me to discuss the offer, and told me that the team wanted me to know that they interviewed several people for the position, but I was their top choice (which really REALLY shocked me!). I accepted! Final notes: Be enthusiastic. Prepare. Don't make yourself seem like all you do with your life is computers, but really, know a lot about coding. Ask intelligent questions (and clarifying questions!). I can't wait to start - good luck to you!

I got the interviewing by turning in my resume at a Microsoft recruiting event on-campus. From there I had an on-campus interview. Took an eternity to hear back from Microsoft and then they told me they wanted me to come up for an onsite interview in the next weeks. Translation: They take 5 months but I only have 2 weeks. After hearing that they wanted me to come onsite I probably had communications with 4 different people to organize the trip and it seemed very unorganized and confusing. All at the same time I was preparing for the onsite interview. Onsite I was treated quite well with all expenses paid however the ferrying around to different buildings for interviews just adds to the stress. As others have stated the lunch interview will be the most awkward lunch of your life so eat lite. I received 3 interviews, not a good sign, as others have stated the more interviews the better. Day later, before I even made it all the way home, got the rejection email. I asked for interview feedback but I got the canned response that it is company policy not to share feedback. Overall not really sure what they are looking for as I feel I coded the questions quite well, have the experience needed, and communicated my thought process thoroughly throughout.

All started with handing out my resume at my university's carrier fair. MSFT's (Microsoft) rep was an SU Alumni and I had a recommendation which I guess helps a lot initially. We spoke about my projects, my interests, and how I like spending time, etc etc... I was shortlisted and an on-campus 1:1 interview was scheduled. This was a 30 to 45 minutes interview. Everyone were asked a programming question and a testing question. Both were pretty simple, coding question was to count the occurrences of every character in a given string. And the Testing question that I vaguely remember was to write test cases for a function that takes a string as input and does something. I was also asked to describe any scalability issue that I had faced in my previous projects. Then I was called for a final round of interviews to Seattle for an SDET position. On the day of the interview recruiter said I will be interviewing with Windows team. Thats a huge team and I could be interviewed by any team within it. But this already sounded exciting to me! 1st interview was with a team lead from Kernel Team. He said he wanted to start my day with less rigorous coding question and asked me to write a function to return the nth Fibonacci number in the series, given integer n. I discussed my design choices before start the code, then wrote a first function where I used arrays, which was inefficient for a large input and then I discussed use of a liked list instead of arrays which wasn't any better with its memory foot print, then it flashed to me that I dont have to store the whole series and I just have to return what ever is required... He also asked for a recursive solution and asked to compare both solutions. Testing question was more of a learning for next rounds than the answers i gave. But learning is important. 2nd round was with another team lead from Hyper-V team. Coding question was to rotate an image by 90 deg. Image is represented by a 2D int array. After bit of crumbling, I came to a solution. I was asked to device strategy to my own code. Again it was half learning from the interviewer and applying what I had learnt from earlier interviewer. 3rd one was a lunch interview, so no coding question but lot of testing questions. Also he was expecting me to ask back as many questions. 4th and final was with a manager. He asked a simple puzzle, a coding question to reverse a linked list using recursive technique. He also asked me about how other interviews went. Did a lot of talking here, not technical all the time, but about the day to day work at MSFT, about the team and what they are working on, etc. After couple hours, I heard from the recruiter that I did get through!

I applied at a campus career fair and was invited to an on-campus interview with Microsoft. The recruiter that scheduled my interview sent me two invitations and three separate confirmations. None of the confirmations were at the same time, and two of them were with different people on top of that. I wrote back to confirm the third confirmation and then showed up at that time only to learn that my interview was scheduled for a different time entirely. The issue was ironed out and my interviewer ended up missing his lunch break to interview me. He asked me a data structure question and had me work out the answer on paper. I worked it out and tried to explain it to him, but he seemed fairly disinterested. He then followed up by asking me how I would test my solution, and then he left. I was pretty frustrated at the scheduling snafu so I probably didn't do as well as I could have. Over a week later I was informed that they wouldn't be going forward.

Mine is an Internship. Submit resume during campus career sessions. Got on campus interview (1st round, 1:1) 2 weeks later. Received result 2-3 weeks later and booked a date for on site interview after 2 weeks. Took almost 2 month before go to the final round. Got every notification of the process usually when forgot about it, but usually required to reply within one or two days. On site consists of 4-5 rounds 1:1 interviews with senior engineers/leaders/managers, including one lunch interview (coding maybe required before or after taking the food, so better have somthing "light" :]) Interviewers were nice, chat with them about your ideas and concerns will help you get as much support to finish the questions as possible. Ask questions to show your type of interests, this will help them decide which product team you are fit in. Prepare to brain storm when answering testing questions, better let them stop you than stop generating ideas yourself. You may get a decision shortly after the final round of interview and the offer ducument may be ready in days. Prepare to code on paper, review basic data structures and algorithms before go onsite. Sleep well before the interview, that's immportant. Generally, the work place is good, not much difference from Universities. Different office/building styles depending on the year of the building. Perfect transit system across the company. People get used to talk and walk in the rain. Many people from places other than Redmond initially. Not much time to look round during the onsite days.

Applied through university, was contacted a few days later for an on-campus interview. Was invited to have an on-site interview in Redmond 4-5 weeks later. 4 interview rounds. The three most important skills they were looking for are: 1) the ability to code well 2) the ability to test correctly and creatively 3) the ability to learn quickly Microsoft provides many great resources for preparing for your interview and if you utilize them correctly, the interviews you will face should not be terribly difficult.

The interview process was very smooth. However, as Microsoft is a giant company, I suspect that this depends largely on the recruiters that a candidate works with. After 2 phone interviews, one of which is a screening from the recruiter, I was invited for an on-site at their headquarters, with the SQL Azure group. All 5 interviewers were nice and enjoyed interviewer me. Three of them are super sharp and I learned a hell lot during the interview day. To put my experience into context, I also interviewed and received offers from Facebook and Palantir. The interviews at these companies, although difficult, felt more like programming tests with little time for high level research discussions.

I first got an interview by handing in my resume at a career fair. I chatted with the guy a bit, but he wasn't the chief recruiter so I didn't expect much. However, 2 weeks later I got a notice that I would have an on campus interview. The interviewer seemed kind of awkward and I didn't get the programming question right, but to my surprise I got an email a week later saying I would be flying out to Redmond to interview. Although the email said I would have flexibility in scheduling, when I was contacted 5 days later, it was with a "you're flying out this Thursday" (they notified me of this Monday). Couldn't get it rescheduled, but hey, it's Microsoft. I flew out for their 2 day interviewing event for the Online Services Division, during which they comp you plane tickets, hotel for 2 nights, money for cabs, and stipends for meals. They take you out in a limo bus on the night before interviews to "meet recruiters", but overall that was pretty useless and you basically just start stressing out with all your fellow interviewees. The next day you have 3-5 45 minute interviews (each is 1:1). They're pretty difficult, but the nice thing is they give you your results (offer or no offer) right after you finish. Overall it's a stressful process, one which is unnecessarily drawn out. But the interviewers on site were overall pleasant people. The whole process just feels a little bit like an episode of American Idol.

My interview was for a MSIT SDE position, so my experience may have been somewhat different from interviews with product groups. I had my resume given to a recruiter by a classmate who was recently hired by Microsoft. I was given a phone interview in December, and on the phone was told that I would be contacted for an in-person interview at the Redmond Campus. I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates. Free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and I think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day. In January, I received information and scheduling for my on-site interview. Microsoft paid for my flight, hotel, food and other costs. In February I was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews, at the end of which I would find out whether or not I would be given an offer. I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates that evening. There was free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. We were given packets that had our schedule for the next day, stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group. **The Interview** We were shuttled to the Microsoft campus, where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview. First Interview: Met with a SDET who had been with Microsoft for over a decade, and had been a PM previously. Very friendly, asked mainly general questions about my experience, what I'm interested in, etc. Then, he asked me to design a subscription service system. After asking a few questions I found that he wanted the tech stack that I would build it on, with justifications for some of the choices. Overall, this interview went very well. Second Interview: I met with a PM who asked me some more general questions, asked me about a previous project I had worked with. No technical questions, and this interview also went quite well. Third Interview: Meeting with a SDET who asked me about past experience, how I got into software engineering (since I'm an MIS major). He then asked me how I would test the whiteboard, followed by how to test a piece of paper. Finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. He then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. The testing questions threw me a bit initially, but I still felt pretty good by the end of the interview. Fourth Interview: Met with an SDE who briefly asked me about my resume, then jumped into questions on OOP. Can you explain OOP to me. What is a class? What is an object? What is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks? Does C# or Java allow multiple inheritance? How is this problem solved? Finally she asked me to reverse a linked list, which I completely botched. I had seen it several times before, but just couldn't get the algorithm right. I didn't solve it before our time ran out, and had to leave it unfinished. At this point, I was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. We were taken to lunch and when we returned, we were told our results would be given to us shortly. My name was called first, which I assumed meant the worst. The recruited told me, "I hate to do this to you, but we want you to meet with one more member of the team." I had a final interview with another SDE, he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. I was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. I nailed this question, which I think got me the offer. I was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team, how true this is I don't know. I then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results, and was finally called back and told I was getting an offer. Final Thoughts / Advice The process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. If you can, make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. It helps you gain confidence, because you get to see them as normal people, not some sort of mythical geniuses. Plus, by being sociable, displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity, you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers. My surprise fifth interview was with a guy who I had a pretty good conversation with the night before and joked a bit with during the event.

I had a one-on-one interview last week. The interview started on time and a very senior engineer spoke with me. We started with my experience and then he asked me to code this problem:      Find the probability of legal moves made by a knight in a NxN matrix in m steps. I had heard this problem for the first time and I decided to give my best shot at it. I started thinking aloud and was exploring if I can use combinatorial maths to solve the problem. Later on I tried to find a pattern but that didnt succeed either. Then I moved on to applying dynamic programming technique by which time interviewer interrupted and told me to use something simpler and start from a specific point in matrix (btw, I have figured out a generic algo using dynamic programming now). Then I took a step back and modeled the problem using a tree (and coordinate geometry) where each node specifies a position in matrix . Also, each node would know if its a "legal" node or not based on its coordinates. Using DFS, we can calculate the number of legal moves and divide by the total number of legal moves. The complexity of this algo was exponential but it worked :-) After figuring out the algo, I was asked to write a working code and I was already running out of time. I quickly wrote the classes and the main method. For brevity of time, I cut out the input validations and just wrote the meat of the logic. Interviewer asked me if I can think of any optimizations. I had many ideas floating in my head but they were very fluid. After all, it wasn't an easy problem and as far as I am concerned, it could be a Master's thesis problem as I was hearing this problem for the first time :-) Interviewer was very polite and I enjoyed speaking with him. But I got a decline from Microsoft :-( I am not sure what the reason could be but I am just wondering that are there no marks for original thinking on the feet, even if the solution wasn't the most optimal? I can bet that if someone even in microsoft is asked to work on complex problems, it might take a few hours, if not days. And even if he is given the most optimal solution on a paper, implementing that in code within an hour would be a challenge. Maybe its sour grapes, but I think there is something lacking in interview process -shouldn't original thinking be given more weightage than getting the right solution? And how can one guage in interview that a person has R&D mindset or not? For the last 2 days I have been thinking about the problem and yesterday I discovered a technique using dynamic programming which is more generic and very optimal. Can the interview process which runs for a few hours capture this? If Microsoft expects people (who are hearing about a problem the first time) to do R&D, design and code in one hour, without any bugs, then all the professors in MIT should be churning out research papers at the rate of one paper per hour :-) Thanks for going through my rant....

I interviewed via my college's campus recruiting. I had an on-campus interview which consisted of an easy programming question. A few days later, they offered to fly me out to WA for interviews. On site interviews took an entire day. I was asked to do some white board coding, some O(n) questions, and some basic CS questions. In general, knowledge of algorithms and data structures was useful. Since this was for a test position, any code I wrote was followed up by "and how would you test that?" Providing test cases in an organized, well thought out manner was all that took. Overall, a pretty typical software engineering interviewing experience. Easier than both Google and Facebook in terms of question difficulty.

The recruiter asked me what my preferences were for the teams I'd like to work with, along with how I felt about relocating to Seattle. The company takes care of travel and lodging, they put you in a hotel and you get up to $75 a day for meals at the hotel. $75 is more than plenty for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The company also reimburses costs for rentals or taxis, after the day long onsite interviews they gave out 3 taxi vouchers to go visit downtown Seattle. On the interview day, you first meet with your recruiter, they will then direct you to the first person you interview with. At Microsoft, each developer has an office, so you meet with them at their office, and the interview is conducted there. Each interviewer then takes you to the next interviewer, and *they talk to each other* before your interview begins. Any weaknesses or flaws are exchanged I believe. I went through 5 interviews. I also had lunch with one of my interviewer.

The interviewer has very severe accent and for an international student, it was hard to understand him. We didn't talk much about my resume, but at first he gave me a hard problem - how many 0s are there in 100 ! - (he himself said it was quite difficult) and his reason was that I said in my resume that I had won an award in math in my high school. And i failed to solve it. He gave me another one - write a function to provide all the permutations of an array - which should be easy to solve, but I failed, maybe because I wasn't recovered from the first failure.

I was contacted by a Recruiter. She lead me to believe that she worked at Microsoft. That was not true. I came to find out that a v- infront of the email address means VENDOR. I was asked standard technical questions and some problem solving questions. I spoke about my experience and education. I did not answer the weird problem solving questions. I WOULD ENCOURAGE others to do the same. I spoke with many non native English speakers. The inperson interviews were fine. Once again, I did not do the mind game questions. As potential employees, you can set the stage, you have power. I told one person that I was not going down that road, he did not understand.

I dropped my resume at the Microsoft booth at a career fair. I got an email that had me indicate what timeslots they listed were possible for me, for a phone interview. I also filled out a form to show what position, what development layer, etc I was interested in working in most. I provided my number and my skype name, and said that skype was the most convenient for me. On time, a woman called me on skype (no video) and the interview went right along. She seemed very good at interviewing. It felt very comfortable talking to her, and she made you feel justified in your thinking, and prompted you if you ran out of ideas. The "fun questions" as she called it seemed like brainstorming ideas, anything and everything you think of, you should mention. Get the corner cases, remember safety checks. I got an email 30 minutes after the phone interview ended saying I didn't make the cut. It said I was close, and offered to consider me for a support position, or interview for the developer position again in 2 months. In total, I communicated with 3 different women--the one that scheduled the interview, the interviewer, and the one that followed up on the interview. I asked for feedback/advice from the last woman in my thank-you reply, but she was somewhat dismissive. Otherwise, the vibe I got was okay. Everyone was courteous.

The question was given the definition of a Fibonacci sequence, write a function to give the n-th term of the sequence. I recognized right off the bat that there was both a recursive and non recursive solution to the problem. I wanted to code the non recursive solution because it would be inherently better than the recursive solution. However, the interviewer asked me to do the recursive one instead. I stumbled a little bit with the special cases but quickly realized my error and came up with the correct solution. My concern was that I did not slam dunk this like most people do but I still managed to come up with the correct solution. Problem is I'm not quick enough.

I had an on-campus interview at my University, where the interviewer focused on design issues and basic algorithmic questions. I can remember couple of questions - how to determine if two circles intersect and how should a server behave if it has to crash (maybe gracefully) and come back up. On-site interview was scheduled after a month's wait, and I had to schedule it for the next month since they had no slots. December-Jan is the holiday season, I guess! On-site interview was 5 rounds. First two involved coding and then coming up with as many test cases as I could for that code, to achieve maximum coverage. 3rd was the lunch interview with test lead and very casual - mostly just chatting about the interviewer's experience with Microsoft so far, and many questions on my projects and internship. Fourth one with a test lead was tougher - totally testing oriented where I had to fix a piece of code he wrote on the board, and then many test cases for that piece of code. Also a very interesting question on how to test a map where he gave me an upside down map and we had a discussion on whether it was valid (it was an Australian classroom map, and valid.) Fifth interviewer was the test manager, and we had a great time classifying test cases for testing the find function on notepad.

Met with the collage recruiter in career fair. Then had a 1.1 interview on the campus. After a few weeks on-site is offered. Then it is rescheduled for the next month. On site consisted of 5 1.1 interviews. First you meet with your recruiter chat about your hobbies or your plans for your career. Then, she directs you to the first interviewer. Each interviewer escorts you to the next one. The third one is most of the time lunch interviewer. During the lunch he may ask about your projects or some technology related questions. Then, I had two more interviews. The forth one was with a lead dev and the last one was with a manager. Don't think that you will get the job if you made to the manager. At least that's not happened in my case. I got the nearly all the questions right during the day. Asked a lot of questions about company, technologies they are using or about the products. However, in the end since a lot of people are applying they have the chance to very picky. Overall, everything was really smooth and professional. Probably I'll apply again in the future. Good luck to all of you.

The interviews consisted for 2 phone screens and an onsite interview. First phone-screen was with the manager of the group and focused on my experiences and some technical questions, e.g. "How would you approach testing an elevator?", "Hint: first list types of testplans you will need to write, and only then specific tests". Second phone screen was with one of the senior team members, was similar with the first one but more relaxed. After completing the phone cycle I got an email from the recruiter with invitation to come in for an in-person interview. My interview from what I head was not typical, since it started at 9AM and lasted up until 5. I met 6 interviewers. Several Senior Test leads, Development leads, developers and testers. Most interviews had "HR component" or general questions about testing and coding, with question such as: if you have a conflict with your subordinate how would you resolve it? if your product has 6 features, but your team has time to test only 5 - how would you chose which one to exclude? Core coding questions were fairly expected, and easy. The language of choice did not matter, as long as you can write psuedocode.

The process started of with 3 phone interviews with the hiring manager, a senior program manager and a senior engineer. The interviews were heavily geared towards technical questions around Operating Systems (virtual memory, busy waiting, context switching etc.), Algorithms, Data Structures and SQL Server internals. After having done well in these interviews I was flown over to Seattle for on-site interviews. I had 5 1-on-1 interviews with engineers on the team. Each interview typically required me to whiteboard a programming problem and/or a mathematical puzzle. There was also some questions around SDLC, unit testing etc.

Each interview followed a similar pattern: discuss your work, tell me about [software engineering topic] and your experience with it, now let’s do a coding problem. Sometimes I did a problem quickly and they made the problem more complicated, or gave me a completely separate one. I was not asked riddle-type questions. I was not asked dumb, typical HR-type questions (“What’s your biggest weakness?”). Between every interview they will talk to each other and they will send e-mails to the other people in the interview loop. Yes, they’re talking about you behind your back. And yes, they will tailor future questions to cover areas missed by previous interviewers, or to follow up on a weakness. Also, not every interviewer is on the team you’re interviewing for. I liked this because it gave me an opportunity to learn more about other groups. In the first interview, the coding problem was to generate a well-known data set. I first considered how to generate the nth iteration of the dataset, but she quickly steered me to solving iterations 1-n (which is much easier). I went over the algorithm in my head and out loud, before writing any code. Then I wrote the simplest, naive code that I could think of. I immediately saw some inefficiencies and worked to address them. She prodded me slightly to the answer she was looking for (I would have gotten there).

Just had the phone interview so no idea on the outcome yet. The interviewer was very friendly and knowledgeable and offered plenty of opportunities to ask questions about the company, the position and so on. We then talked about my resume and what projects I'd worked on. He asked me about my most technically challenging project and the various issues I encountered as well as how I solved them in detail. He then asked a brain teaser / algorithm type question which took a little coaching for me to get right. I'd revised quite hard on data structures and algorithms but found myself rather unprepared for the question. I didn't get the perfect answer but made sure to keep talking and offering up suggestions. This led to me being asked other questions which I could answer easily. Overall, it was a friendly interview but I'm 50/50 on if I'll get a call back.

Applied through the Microsoft website and interviewed on-campus. I was pleased to hear that I was selected to be flown up to Seattle and interview with the online services division (Bellevue, WA not Redmond). I will state early on that I completed the interview process and received no offer - however, with that said, I will be as objective as I can be about the experience. Firstly, understand that although Microsoft does every single thing possible to try to show how "fun" they are, by far the number one thing the interviewers look for is the ability to think and code just like any other large software company. Everyone who says that it's important to be social and personable at Microsoft must have interviewed with a different division. With online services, all that matters is coding, problem solving, and wanting to tackle new problems. During your day you will have four 45 minute interviews, with 15 minute breaks in between. After that you will hear immediately whether or not an offer will be extended. This is absolutely amazing by Microsoft. To have that feedback so instantaneously is incredible and truly first-class of the company. These interviews will be intimidating to say the least and I can virtually guarantee you that you will run into one or two people that you really like and think are cool, and one or two that make you second-guess if you really want to work there. Each interview has a coding question. My four were as follows: 1) Given the in-order and preorder traversals of a binary tree, rebuild the tree. 2) Given a sparse n-by-m matrix, find the number of distinct paths within that matrix (each cell can be off or on, find the number of distinct sets of connected cells). 3) Given the Android 3x3 matrix lock screen, generate all the possible unlock combinations that one can enter. 4) Given an array of integers, find all the unique elements. I botched the first question. It was 8AM in the morning when I attempted it and I had been up since 6:30. To be quite honest, I had forgotten to review the tree algorithms. I met with the interviewer and he literally bombarded me with questions. If you say *anything* be prepared to defend it and back it up. There is also a strong sense that you must be very, very interested in working for Microsoft. As one Microsoftie put it, "the people who work at Microsoft choose to work there because they love Microsoft, it's not that they cannot work for Google or Apple". There is little to no review of your resume. The emphasis is pretty much solely on your ability to code relatively generic, albeit challenging, programming problems. This can work to your advantage or it can be a disadvantage. To ace the interview, simply read a number of programming problems and study up on the division you are interested in. At one point in time, I was asked: "if you were given a farm of 1000 computers, say, what problem would you try to solve?". Find something that Microsoft is trying to solve, or some generic problem in the division for whom you are interviewing. As I was not extended the offer, I cannot precisely tell you what it takes to succeed in the interview. However, here are a couple of observations I made (some of which are listed earlier): 1) Read up on the division for whom you are interviewing and understand their business well. 2) Read up on many, many coding questions. If you read enough problems, chances are you will have heard a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve. 3) I cannot stress this enough, but to succeed you *must* ace the first interview you have. I told you how I botched the first question. I did not think to use recursion. In a later interview I had a question that could have used recursion (implementing a BFS), but I chose the iterative process. The interviewer remarked to me, "your first interviewer noted that you don't use recursion, why don't you?". These interviewers talk to each other in between! As such, you must absolutely make a good first impression. If you can interview with Microsoft, it is a cool experience. You get two free nights in a nice hotel room and all your expenses paid. It makes for an awesome trip to Seattle. However, I really wish Microsoft would cut down on the number of people they bring to Seattle. Reading through Glassdoor, you will see *a lot* of people are not extended offers. Why bring these people if you don't extend a great deal of offers? I feel their current system unfairly generates a lot of false hopes. If you are interviewing with the big M, I wish you the best. You will have a fun experience and it will be really cool to even just walk through those doors once. As the guy who told me the sad end-of-day news put it, "we receive 10,000 resumes a week, and the fact that you made it this far attests to your skills". Be proud that you received the interview and enjoy your experience!

My resume was forwarded to this group through a friend. The recruiter got in touch to schedule a phone screen. They scheduled an additional one. First one focused on a string manipulation question and basic computer science, and OO concepts (stuff like threading basics, polymorphism). Also asked about work experience. Second one focused a lot more on my understanding of memory allocation - had to point out challenges/errors on a given custom memory allocator. And another question was an array-of-integers-related question. Was called onsite a week later. Had 5 rounds of interviews. Questions based on a mix of understanding of Computer science concepts—such as multi-threading, client-server behavior, http basics, scalability etc—and algorithms/coding as well as testing ability. Some of the coding related questions: reversal of sentence, sorting an array based on its modulo 'k' value, a 2-D array sorting related question. I got the offer a week later and accepted it.

I was initially contacted by an MS recruiter who had found articles on my blog related to a skills they were currently hiring from. I had an initial phone screen with the recruiter, followed by a phone interview with a test manager a few days later. The phone screen consisted of basic coding tests done via live meeting. A few weeks later I visited the Redmond campus for a series of in-person interviews with several other test engineers. The interview series consisted of 4 - 5 in-person interviews, each with a single test engineer, each consisting of either coding on a whiteboard or testing applications. The interviews progressed in difficulty as the day went on.

I've been through this process with Amazon and Google before and the phone screening process is pretty much the same. Not too many questions about resume or experience but algo and data structure questions. Got a response the next day to tell me they wanted to bring me in for 1:1 interviews. Trip was schedule for the following week and the process is made very easy by the recruiter. They take care of everything for you and you just have to approve the final travel arrangements. My on-site interviews started with a 30 minutes meeting with my recruiter. He then brought me back to the lobby area where the first interviewer (an SDET II) came to get me. We went to his office. We went through a couple of algo and data structure problems and he then asked me questions about design patterns and other behavioral stuff. It was about 60 minutes including some time for me to ask questions. The next interview was over lunch (also with an SDET II) but was very similar. Being during lunch, the discussion seems a little more casual but you are still being interviewed and you still have to solve problems. The last interview was with a Senior SDET Lead, in his office. He gave me an algo problem and a UI design question. The rest was based on my past experience and some behavioral questions. We ended up spending more time talking than solving problems. I was pretty confident after the first 2 interviews but it all went downhill during the 3rd one. The reaction and facial expressions of my interviewer made me feel like I was getting it all wrong.

An initial university interview with a campus recruiter went well and left a positive impression. The interview consisted of some string manipulation questions, substring searching... standard stuff. The recruiter was engaging and had a lot of good answers to my questions. After that, I was invited out to Redmond for interviews, and that is where things were a bit off. I was scheduled for the afternoon interviews, with my latest interview being around 5:00. Being from the eastern side of the US, this was quite late for me and I was very sleepy by the end of it. We were told we would be given lunch before our interviews, but no lunch was given leaving those of us who had not eaten fairly hungry. I also found out I was being interviewed for the wrong position due to a clerical error. All of my interviewers (there were 4) except for one were rushed and had little to no time for questions from me at all. They had been doing interviews all day and did not really seem to care or want to speak with me about anything but their technical questions so that they could move on to the next candidate. Each of the 4 interviews consisted of a few questions about previous projects followed by a technical question that took almost the whole interview time-slot to implement before I was tossed off to another interviewer. Due to jet lag and the late interview times, my later interviews did not go too well and I was quite burned out by the end of it. They had a fun lobby with a MS Surface, Guitar Hero and other entertainment, but the people just seemed cold and uncaring compared to other companies with whom I had interviewed in the past.

I applied for IT SDET/SDE and product development SDET/SCE through Microsoft's career website and I was contacted by a recruiter asking me to fill out a form where in, I was asked to list the positions that I am interested in Mircosoft's IT division and was also asked to provide times for an initial HR phone screen. I got a response after a week with the confirmed time. For those of you who do not know the difference between IT development and product development, IT development does work for other Microsoft groups where as product development delivers MS products for customers like you and me and other corporations. The initial phone interview was a behavioral interview with the HR. I got a response from her after about 2 days saying they want me to come to Bellevue, WA for an onsite! I was expecting a tech phone screen and it didn't happen.  I flew to Bellevue, WA a day before my interview and that evening all the candidates who had come for the interview met at the hotel lobby and we were taken to a club where we met the HR people and some tech guys who would be interviewing us the next day. We were also given our schedules. I was given the morning schedule. 4 interviews from 8 AM to 1 PM with some breaks in between. These were the questions I was asked in each of them: I did pretty well and I was shocked to learn that I did not make it.No reasons were given and I was asked to re apply after 6 months. Results were delivered immediately at 1 30 PM. It was a tough evening for me! Nice experience. Still disappointed not to make it but I will re apply and get it the next time, if not in MS, in one of the biggies!

I had prior experience working as a contractor at Microsoft so I was familiar work environment. This interview was for Windows Phone Group. One of my colleague who work for MS had forwarded my resume to this opening. I was having a really nice job at one of the fortune 100 company and had solid experience with some 4 of the leading companies in the field. So my profile was good in that sense, but didnt see any mercy while doing 1:1 interviewing for the post. Initial phone interview asked about programming and testing questions. Not very difficult. Then followed by a one day interview which started at 10 am and lasted at around 5.30 pm. First one was one 1:1 hr session(just explained what I will be doing thru the day and what all i look from the job ) . Five 1:1 technical sessions , Initial ones where easy , but as soon as they realize that you are able to answer the initial rounds, the other ones will go tougher and tougher till you break. So you really dont have much idea of how you are doing, but it seems after four rounds you could be relatively safe since the questions are hard to crack questions by then and they also know about that. There is a lunch break that too filled with some technical and some personal talks. By evening you will get exhausted, so keep your energy levels really up till the end. They will give you indications about the result. The last person I met was a higher level manager and he told me ,that they liked me and that I had done well and HR will get back to you. After two days I got the offer. Dont go without enough preparation, for sure its difficult to crack without proper study , prepare well , at least it will give a nice experience . Good thing is even if you don't get its a nice experience.

As this was my first big interview, my experience felt like a whirlwind. I was notified a week to the day before I was to interview at Microsoft's Redmond's Campus. I made it past the first on-campus interview two weeks prior. I was asked to implement a C function that searches a string within a source string( "strstr()" ). I didn't have much time to review, needless to say. I flew into Seattle a day before the interview. That night, there was an nice networking event where we got to meet with our recruiters and even talk with some of the interviewers. The interview process was pretty extensive. I had 4 interviews each 45 minutes long, with 15 minute breaks and between each. The questions ranged from implementing basic data structures on a white board (I was asked to make a Linked List) and some logic problems in my last interview. They even asked me the classic Fizz Buzz function to implement (Google it, or Bing it). I was also asked some basic relational database questions regarding foreign keys and primary keys. I felt like I was unprepared and consequently psyched myself out somewhat. After the interview, a reviewer will notify you if you have a job offer or not. They'll also go over how you did and what you could improve on your resume or skill set. They did a wonderful job and were incredibly professional about everything throughout the process. Here are some tips: Get some sleep. Try to relax during the interview. Don't over optimize your code until after you're done ( I did this on at least two occasions and overlooked some obvious things in my code because I was nervous). Be comfortable with writing at least 2 languages on a white board, one system (C), one object-oriented(Java, C++, C#). Review your database concepts too if you're familar with them. Finally, and most importantly, be yourself. They're more interested in how you think and approach a problem. Hope this helped some soon-to-be college graduates out there! Good Luck

I ended up blanking in two of the interviews, so I didn't receive an offer. None of the questions were especially hard, I would just advise that you are well rested for the interview.

This is an interview for a SDET position as a new college graduate (graduating May 2012). They started out with a phone interview, which consisted of a few (honestly pretty easy) questions. Nothing particularly technical, just stuff like:  - How would you test a calculator?  - If you were stuck inside a conference room with a window, but no network/wifi/smartphone, how would you figure out the temperature outside?  - Tell me about a difficult project you worked on. The phone interviewer was very friendly and it was a great experience. It went pretty well, and I was offered a flight out to Seattle. I'm going to take a quick detour here, for people who've never been flown out on a company's dime before. READ ALL OF YOUR EMAIL VERY CAREFULLY, fill out everything as soon as you get it. If you need to reschedule (due to an exam or something), then TELL THEM. They won't take it personally, they will be happy to work with you to find the date that best fits you. But be sure to tell them this as soon as you can. The on-site interview was very, very pleasant and I had a lot of fun with it. I was given 4 interviews of ~45 minutes each. My group started after lunch. Between interviews, we would have a 15 minute break to go grab a snack, get some coffee, use the restroom, or chat with some of the hiring managers. I had the following questions, one per interview:  - Given an array of integers (of any value, from MIN_INT to MAX_INT), how would you find the consecutive integers with the largest sum?  - Given a string, how would you determine if that string contains a palindrome?  - How would you search a string for a substring, in C? This guy also asked me some questions about hardware and security, such as "describe how a buffer overflow attack works".  - How would you count the NUMBER of palindromes in a string? Other people I was with had other interesting questions, the only one I remember right now is:  - Given a time of day, how would you determine the angle made by the hands of the clock? I didn't get a job offer (I really blew the non-coding portion of my 3rd interview, I needed more practice with hardware-related stuff, and I made a few really dumb mistakes when I was explaining stuff) but it was a great experience. All the free food and the free luxury hotel room certainly helped! One final note: Microsoft wants people who are smart, but also personable. Be friendly, be interesting, chat with your interviewers about their hobbies or interests, or at least chat about what they do. People skills are very important, and if you focus exclusively on the technical aspect of your interview and come off as a humorless robot, you are honestly not going to do well. Hope this helped, good luck!

the process was: presentation in the university, then applying for the job/internship in the site,different recruiters contacted me, the time was arranged for the phone interview they called by skype an hour before the time we agreed (giving me a lie about they couldn't call me by phone) in the middle of interview the connection was lost so we chatted ! the conversation consisted behavioral questions, two puzzles and digging into my resume and my experience and challenges I faced and how I managed to fix them.... the advice would be get ready for behavioral questions, know exactly what the company is looking for by asking people who already worked with them not just Internet. If the interests don't match, you would lose the chance to even show in a real interview what you are able to do for the company!

After the contact at University, there were 2 steps: 1. a phone interview, with few technical questions. it was more like a chat where the interview would like to know why I was applying for MS, what were my expectations, etc. 2. in campus interview, in Redmond. There were 5 interviews in an afternoon, with 5 differents MS employees. Each interview took 50 minutes and there were 10 minutes between each one. Some interviewers asked coding questions, and some just talked ans asked me to explain (verbally, not coding) how I would solve and test some problems. They took 2 and half months after the phone interview to invite me for a in campus interview and the final result was given at the same day of interviews, just a few minutes later.

I submitted my resume in a campus career fair and got a on-campus interview. After two weeks, I got a notification from HR saying that there would be a on-site interview in Redmond, WA. So, I flied to Seattle in the end of that month. I got only 3 interviews over that time, so I knew that I would not have a chance to be selected. The first one was good I think. We talked about some of my experience and why I would like to choose to be a SDET. The question was how to find a difference in two arrays of integers. The second interview was the start of my screw up. I was asked to design a pig bank for coins and write the functions for a queue, like enqueue and dequeue. I didn't feel that well over this time because I thought my interviewer was always staring at me with his poke face, which made me very nervous. I also failed to find out one bug in my function in this time of interview. In my last interview, I spent my time with a very senior USB test software engineer. We talked about the Microsoft history and some of my project experience. I thought I was found that I was not that interested in testing at this moment. Then, we came back to his office and asked me a coding question.

I arrived in Redmond on a Monday evening, interviewed on Tuesday, and then flew out Wednesday afternoon. I drove a rental car about a half hour from the airport to the hotel. The hotel was less than 2 minutes away from the Microsoft campus. All of my expenses were reimbursed. Supposedly, I was given a sight-seeing allowance, but the only time I could visit Seattle would be after my interview. At that point, I was tired after the long interview and it was rush hour, and so I opted to rest and do work in the hotel. After about 10 days, I was contacted by the HR representative who I met during the interview and was told I was not picked for a position. The on-site interview process was strange. I arrived at a lobby designed for Microsoft candidates (there were many Microsoft gadgets available to play with, including a Microsoft Surface and an XBox with Kinect (which would be awkward to actually power on while waiting)). I took a complimentary water bottle to carry with me for the rest of the day. I didn't bring anything with me, but it might have been a good idea to bring a laptop so I could spend the waiting time before my first interviewer researching the group I was interviewing with (I was not told that group ahead of time; instead, I was told there might be many groups, and the interview time would be variable as different groups decided throughout the day to pencil me in for interview time). Everyone seemed a little surprised that the only thing I was carrying with me was a water bottle. I thought it was strange that other candidates came in jeans with a back pack... but apparently that was common. While in the lobby, I could interact with four or five other candidates. There were two rooms with glass doors inside the lobby where HR representatives did entry and exit interviews, and sometimes those interviews could be overheard from sitting anywhere in the lobby. That also seemed a little awkward. Before the interview, I was put in contact with multiple travel and HR representatives. There was a different person in charge of each stage of the process. I was finally told two days before I arrived who I would be meeting with, but when I arrived, I found out she was out sick. So I met with someone filling in with her. He told me that after my last interview (which he couldn't give me any information about), I would come back to the lobby and wait for him, but if I waited more than 15 or 20 minutes, I should feel free to just leave. He told me that either he or the original HR person would be in contact with me, but he wasn't sure who. Eventually, he did show up, gave me my exit interview, and contacted me 10 days later to tell me the results. During the interview, I wasn't given an agenda. I was hurried into a shuttle to take me to the building with my first interviewer. I sat in the lobby of that building for 15--30 minutes, and then I was met by my first interviewer. He took me upstairs to a conference room that he had a hard time finding because he hadn't ever been in it before. Once we found it, I was asked high-level questions about the difference between C, C++, and Java. I was then asked about the existence of certain data structures (singly and doubly linked lists, stacks, maps, etc.). I was given a high-level design problem for extracting data from text files using regular expressions and assembling that data into data structures. I was then hurried to my next interviewer, who asked me to write whiteboard code using C++ flattening specialized doubly linked list structures into pure doubly linked lists. I was then hurried to an interviewer with high-level questions about elevator algorithm design that ended up with coding on paper over lunch (i.e., I was asked to code and eat simultaneously, which was a little strange). I was then hurried to an interviewer who asked me to write C code for doing character processing (reverse letters in a word, then reverse words in a sentence). He also asked me how I thought the earlier interviews went and told me he hadn't read my resume. Finally, I was brought back down to that building's lobby where I picked up a shuttle back to the HR building. My HR rep arrived to meet me after 10 or 15 minutes of waiting. He gave me some tips about touring Seattle that evening (which I wasn't excited about due to rush hour starting), and I was sent on my way.

I submitted my resume to an on-campus recruiter and received an email that same evening. The recruiter wanted to chat on the phone 2 days later, which was was a quick discussion of my background and interests. At the end of the call I was invited to attend a half-day of on-site interviews just 3 days later (after the weekend). The on-site interviews consisted of 4 separate 45 minute 1 on 1 interviews with 4 different Microsoft developers. They asked typical technical design and algorithms questions, and also wanted to spend a lot of time hearing me talk about a project I had worked on in the past. The first interview was very straightforward, but they become progressively more difficult. In later interviews they specifically ask you about topics that your resume indicates you have no experience with, to see how you handle unknown situations. Results were given on the spot by HR, so less than 5 days after first getting in touch with Microsoft a job offer was on the table. Overall an extremely efficient interview process. They are clearly pushing to hire early before top grads get snapped up by their competitors.

Microsoft came to my uni a while ago to find new some recruits. They promised pizza and a chance to win an Xbox if we went to their seminar so I decided to go check it out. They were true to their word about the pizza -- and I gotta say that there was an awful lot of it -- but it turned out that you needed to hand in your resume if you wanted the Xbox! I had to run to a computer to print one out! Anyway, I didn't expect to get a response (my resume's pretty bad) so imagine my surprise when I got an e-mail from them a few weeks later asking me to come in for an interview! My interview was broken up into two parts -- a discussion about my interests and experience and the "fun" part that involved applying my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. The first part involved answering a bunch of questions about me and my interests. It was all the usual things you get in a typical interview, e.g. when did I first become interested in software development, what things have I've worked on... The lady was pretty nice and smiled the whole time so I don't know if my responses were the right ones or not. The skills test was actually easier than I thought it would be. I was ushered into a room with a reasonably friendly guy and he handed me a pen, some paper and a sheet of questions. Over the course of the test, I was told to answer three of them. They were actually things people could've solved given enough time. Unfortunately, it turns out that I don't do well under time pressure and I croaked as a result. When it was over, he thanked me and led me to the door. He said a couple of positive things about me and we went our separate ways. I'm a bit disappointed at myself for messing up. However, it was a good learning experience and I at least got a free Xbox for my troubles.

Applied online late last year, got a call for a phone screen after 4 months. Apparently Microsoft had fired many recruiters and just ramped up on recruiters earlier this year. Phone interview was standard discussion on programming languages, a question on how to test a phone, and a coding question on binary search trees. Straightforward stuff. 2 weeks later was flown on site. Had 5 interviews including the recruiter/HR. Questions ranged from : find a string query in a string pattern, find the smallest integer repeated an odd number of times, remove characters from a string without using additional space, to testing questions such as test a vending machine and test a traffic system. The questions were not that challenging but the focus was on finding edge cases and bugs. The interviews were easy/average, especially when compared to SDE positions. Unfortunately it seems that the negative perception of the SDET position is true: I found that the recruiter and the lead were trying a little too hard to sell me on the SDET position by stating how it is considered the same level as the SDE and/or PM level and there is no difference in salary (if this were true then there is no need to state it during an interview). I blew through the questions with ease and they probably thought I wasnt a good fit even though I was interested in the position as the group was an exciting one to work for and I have and interest in both development and testing.

I got an on campus interview with a Software Development Engineer. It was a 30 minute interview in which he asked one programming questions. I had to write the code on the board. It wasn't too difficult and he continued to probe my mind while I wrote code such as "why this method, how would you test this, is this the most efficient". I ended up getting a pretty good solution and was confident I did well. Although I was not offered an on-site interview. Thinking back on what I would do differently, I would ask more clarifying questions, and more clearly explain why my solution is optimal. I get pretty nervous sometimes which causes me to not explain terms as clear as they can be. However it was a good experience and good interview practice.

Phone interview lasted about 30 minutes. I felt like I underperformed but still got called back. Scheduling the real interview was a pain but very flexible. Interview was 5 individual interviews with different employees within the group, one being a phone interview. 3 focused on programming challenges, 1 on personal motivations/experiences/etc, and the final was a casual interview where I mostly asked questions. The programming interviews were all on a white board, which was the largest difficulty for me personally.

Phone Interview- The interviewer had a standard set of questions and was only looking for your ability to reply as soon as possible. No need to panic. They are in hurry, so you may feel as if they are not listening to you, but they are! Do not expect cross questions. The interview process is extremely streamlined and they always keep you at ease right after your confirmation for on-site interview! Recruiters stay in touch with you through mails for scheduling interview, booking tickets, and suggesting websites/books to prepare. You can take a chance to postpone the interview. You would never feel stressed. Just concentrate on Data Structures! The best interview experience you can get. 1:1- 3-5 interviews including a lunch. If you reach the fourth interview, chances are that you would be selected. Interviewers focus on your ability to question, discuss and analyze the problem. You won't be able to code the question completely in the given time frame, so do not panic. Just discuss the solution at your best! Ask the interviewers for feedback at the end of interviews. Implement the suggestions in next interview.

Submitted resume through my university and got invited to interview on-campus two weeks later. The person in the career fair was very nice and helpful. One day before the interview, the two persons from Microsoft held an event for all the candidates. Very few questions were asked by the candidates as the two interviewers spent a lot of time talking about the company. The day of the interview, the interviewer was nice for about 2 minutes. After that, he started behaving very disinterested and spent more time looking at his laptop screen than listening to what I had to say. His behavior made me very nervous, and plenty of times he interrupted to give me hints that I didn't need. Any pause for a few seconds would result in a comment along the lines of "You aren't doing what I asked." Two weeks after the interview I received an e-mail to tell me I didn't make it to the 2nd round. My overall impression is that unless you can code recursive algorithms in less than five minutes, you shouldn't apply at Microsoft. Also to potential candidates don't forget to prepare for behavioral questions.

Applied online, then was called for an on-campus interview. The on-campus interview was one question about how to test a system like drop box efficiently. I've heard and can vouch that if the on-campus interviewer tells you to expect to be contacted, that you will be sent to Redmond. Two weeks later they contacted me to schedule my flight, then flew out to Redmond all expenses paid and some tourist things too, they made me feel important. It consisted of six 1:1 interviews, the first one being with your recruiter, which is just general and will point you to the first technical one. The first technical interviewer will be a manager and ask you some coding/tech questions, the second interview was the hardest asking about Big(O) speed, how to test different systems, just breathe and keep trying. The 3rd interview is a lunch one followed by a few coding questions on Linked lists. If you make it past the lunch interview you're doing well since they decide after the lunch whether to keep going or not. The 4th interview was more about co-op experience, how to test different things, how did I figure out how to avoid SQL injections and how to find them. Final interview will be with the most senior person, in my cause it was a systems architect, he will ask a few coding questions and more about your experience and why you want to work as an SDET or at Microsoft in general. If things go well at that point he will pretty much be asking you questions that try to get you to want the position.

It is very easy to assume that you know it and when the interview day comes, you may end up confusing yourself. Please treat programming languages as a tool to implement a functionality and not as the most important thing. The concept is what is important.

I was a contractor and my manager offered me to try for a full time position. It went well up to the last guy, the one who was going to make The Decision. The guy was in his 50s and one of the very early MS employees. For some reason he just didn't like me much and his behavior throughout the interview was very rude and arrogant. It blew me away how he took his socks off and started picking dirt between his toes while I was answering questions. Needless to say, I didn't like it much and I guess it ended the "Microsoft experience" for me. All other interviewers were nice and willing to cooperate (i.e. no grilling tactics). After two weeks of "deciding" they finally told me that they are not going to offer me a position. But since I stayed as a contractor my manager actually told me (off the record) that the Big Boss indeed didn't like me from the moment I walked in. Questions weren't exactly too challenging, in a normal range of a SDET.

The whole process was pretty swift, there was the first interview in college after which they offered me an on-site interview. Were pretty flexible with scheduling the interview and also took care of travel & hotel expenses. The actual interview lasted one day, first I went to the Recruiting center where I met my recruiter and talked to him for a while, then I took the shuttle and was off to my first interview. The interviewer asked various questions, some were related to APIs, some were related to my earlier experience, and some were general problem solving questions. I had four different interviews that day and that pretty much was it. After that I came back to the recruiter office, talked with my recruiter again and the next day told me their decision.

I began the interview process after meeting with a Microsoft recruiter at my university. Within a few days, I had a phone interview scheduled. I had two of these and they were very, very easy; if you cannot make it past the phone interviews either you didn't get anything out of school or Microsoft doesn't want you. I was then invited to fly up to Bellevue, WA to interview for the Bing! team. I had to solve whiteboard problems in front of five different team members. I felt that some of the interviewers were somewhat disrespectful - one guy pulled out his laptop as I was solving/explaining a problem. I also had a lunch interview with some kind of manager that went pretty awkwardly. The guy didn't say much and I didn't have much to tell him since he was pretty closed off. I thought I did well overall except for an interview question where they asked me to implement a Sudoku solver.

Glass door limits the no. of characters i use.so im gonna get straight to business! Interview day: Interview 1: Initially scheduled for three interviews, first beginning at 10.30 AM 21st Feb, 2011. My interviewer decided not to show up for the day so i spent about 45 mins waiting in the lobby .At 11.15 this other guy working on the same team as the guy who was initially supposed to interview me came and took me to his office.,.. We generally started interviewing here and he asked some of my project related questions..No code here. Interview 2: My lunch interview was with this really young chap..we ate..taked generally..After lunch we walked back to his office... BAM! gives a marker pen in my hand... n acts as if he doesnt know me at all.. says How would you implement a program which would return a copy of a linked list given the head pointer of the original linked list.(Im giving away my questions coz i did not sign any NDA!).. talked it out quite a bit..developed logic from scratch, wrote pseudo-code, checked-double checked boundary conditions... got the logic approved.. said there are 2 ways to do it.iterative and recursive.. he asked which would you prefer when and why? I explained takin into consideration space, time, situation where the algo would actually be used and so on...he was happy with it.and then i coded it..done!. then he suggested another variant where every node of the linked list had a random pointer (in addition to the next pointer) which could randomly point to another node or be NULL..how would you duplicate such a linked list???? This was a little tricky...but doable..i got it right..everything went off fine.. he then takes me to the next interviewer. Interview 3: Again a young chap..asked a quick question about a past project. n then went straight to the white board... explaned in 3-4 sentences what BFS is.n then said..given a BST..how would you implement a variant of BFS wherein you print the first node... then the nodes in the next level from right to left.then the nodes in the next level from left to right..n the next from right to left and so on.. he asked me to give him data structures and the algo...quite tricky.neva saw this qs before.got stuck a lil..but he hinted me at very specific points...n i was quick to pick up on it.. i figured it out eventually..it can be done using 2 stacks.. I liked this question..then he says i have 15 mins left.n he throws another problem at me.asks me to strategize and code the following problem... usually in linked lists. whenever you create a node.you dynamically allocate some memory and attach a node..but what if you were given some preallocated amount of memory.. in an array..and each element of your array would have a pointer to a node of a linked list. how would you insert into an linked list in this case???..think about it..interesting question..I solved it.but dint have time to code it Interview 4: Really old chap..very very very experienced.. Principal Development Lead for UI in Windows 7... .he asks me about this one project i did in grad school..its was a computer vision project..i explained it on the white board..n in a way i was glad he asked that question since that was one of ma favourite projects and i did reall well in it...he liked what i said.,.. then he draws this on the board: algorithms--API--User experience.. n talks about how API's kinda join work going on in both ends.. n says there are jobs in all three fields..if given a choice..which would you prefer i said more towards the left side of the line.. n he made a note of it... then we again sat back and started talkin bout a lot of stuff..went of pretty ok.. n finally he asked me a design question.how would you implement a linked list class.. simple question..but im kinda weak in the my class design concepts having working mostly in c... but i took sum help from him and figured it out.. he was ok with it..after a while he said im done.for the day. I get back to my room at the marriott.. heavily retrospecting... i felt i performed brilliantly through the day.. trust me guys..im not being conceited here... i really felt i did well.n i cudin think of a single place where i made a crucial mistake or anythin... i did take help in a couple of occasions.. but im guessing they don hold that against you.. 2 days later my recruiter calls and says that they usually give out rejects by email.but he called me to give the news coz my decision was a tough one to make n it was real close... which i din feel was a consolation at all... i asked him for one.jus one reason/hint wateva..off/on the record...i don care...but he said its company policy not to give out feedback..... was dead disappointed with it.... took me a while to get over it,,...

He told me the key was to match software key words in my resume and list different class projects. I took his advice and got the interview. During the interview process the interviewer asked for my academic background, and then asked a few questions on that background. One such question was: what is the main reason for pipelined processors? - Answer is to increase throughput.

Got an interview thru a referral. 20-30 mins telephone interview. There was an online assessment test of about 1.5 hours prior to the interview. Type of questions: Behavioral, technical (but, very high level view and no coding as such), knowledge about the position and products Advice: It's a very short interview. So, keep your answers brief and get to the point. I wasn't asked if I had any questions and was told that they would get back to me in 1-2 weeks. They sent me an email the very next day and told me that they weren't interested in going forward with me.

The difficult part was the time duration of the interview. Since it was supposed to last about 20 minutes, I shouldn’t have tried to explain my answers like in a behavioral interview. I should have gotten to the point by giving brief answers.   Answer Question

I was contacted by a lady from spherion staffing services(but had the microsoft email ID though with spherion in brackets), I think they do the initial talent search for Microsoft, which i came to know off after i spoke about my interview to one of my friend who works there. After the online technical and personality test i was scheduled for a phone interview. The interview lasted for 45 minutes in which i was asked the same question which i saw in all the forums before i took the phone interview. The person asked me why i wanted to work in Microsoft, why did i want to be a software developer and not a tester, what would i do if i am stuck in a problem at work, and asked me to describe a project I had done. He then asked me, how would i design a calculator and asked me what would i do if i need to find details about a guy whose resume is with me and there is no contact details about the person in the resume. The phone interview was not technical and after 3 days i got a reply saying that they pursued another candidate. As far as i am concerned i did stutter a bit for some of the question since English is not my first language, which might have been my downfall.

Asked about how to locate a element in an rotated, sorted array. You've been given an array that is sorted and then rotated. example Let arr = [1,2,3,4,5] which is sorted and then rotated say twice to the right to give [4,5,1,2,3] This can be done in O(logN) using a slightly modified binary search. The interesting property of a sorted + rotated array is that when you divide it into two halves, atleast one of the two halves will always be sorted. I am not interested in the groups of developing explorers, so I did not proceed.

The interview consisted of 2 written tests, 2 telephonic interviews and 1 face to face interview where I met 6 people. I was very much interested in the development position, but somehow they pushed me to take SDET interview. The team was friendly. Was asked couple of standard puzzles, technical questions related to linked list, dictionary, doubly linked list, binary tree, reversing words in a string, etc. They also asked whether I am passionate about testing and I was not. Although all the rounds went fine, probably they felt I was not at all interested or passionate about testing and they made the right decision of not giving me offer :-)).

I applied online and was contacted by a recruiter. The recruiter was very helpful throughout the process even though I did not get the job. I had 2 phone screenings: one by the recruiter which was general questions and some technical trivia. The other was a more technical interview consisting of some coding and testing problems. Then I was flown over to Redmond and had 4 interviews back to back on campus. They weere all very technical and testing oriented.

Applied to be a developer, but was interviewed as a developer, a tester, and a program manager. Was given only half an hour to describe my hardest programming project, what my favorite piece of software was and how I would improve it, to describe how I would design a GPS system for hardcore hikers/backpackers differently from a system for casual campers/hikers (something that stumped me, because I have never used a GPS before for these activities and did not know how to answer, and the interviewer was not very helpful in explaining why the groups have different needs), and to describe how I would test a program. Felt very rushed compared to other interviews I've had, and as a result it probably impacted my ability to answer satisfactorily (though it is hard to tell what they were looking for).

My first interview was a 30 minute on-campus screen: one puzzle question and a few short, general CS questions. If you know anything at all, this is a piece of cake. The remainder of this review describes my on-site experience. Regarding travel arrangements: I experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey, but the travel team was very supportive and helpful, extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight. Regarding the interviews: most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate (just note that they generally do NOT ask “mount Fuji” questions anymore), and as there is a lot of it (if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company) I will only give a brief outline of my experience. I arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. After checking in at the desk, I had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. They provide free drinks, xbox, and some weird machines running a program called something like “tell us about yourself,” which I tried to use unsuccessfully. The recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day, some interview advice, and a little about my goals and background; nothing technical or difficult. The first 30 minutes of my first “real” interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since I had never heard of it. The remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting: design, complexity, and pseudocode. He had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. Next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. There was a wide selection of reasonably priced food (though I had a voucher for a free lunch). I decided on a salad for ease of eating. We talked about the company, the team and my goals. Back in his office, I worked out two problems on trees coded up in C++. The next interview was entirely coding; two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble; it was the craziest recursion I’ve ever seen. Make sure you practice with trees a lot, and don’t bother much with general graphs. The interviewer gave me lots of tips, and I finished the code at the last minute. The fourth interview was more like the earlier ones; relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question, in this case design. I had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. Pretty open ended… I think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs (memory vs. speed and so on). Finally I was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences—no technical questions. Be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume—difficulties you encountered, what you learned, etc. I briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. In a few days, I heard the good news from the recruiter. So my advice is: 1) ask questions, be curious, and be enthusiastic about the team/product and the company. If you are having a “conversation“ and not just a dry Q&A, then you are probably doing this well. 2) spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3) don’t code silently. 4) practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview--preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. It really helps! 5) try to learn something from each interview, anything, then use it in a later interview; ESPECIALLY if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. They want you to succeed. Remember this if you get nervous. This is mostly drawn from advice I’ve heard elsewhere, but I found it to be particularly useful. Good Luck! Also, everyone I encountered at Microsoft was very nice and personable. The interviews felt mostly relaxed and enjoyable.

I applied on microsoft.com/careers for multiple positions. About a month later I was emailed a document which included some questions asking me to rate myself in various programming languages as well as a coding question. The question was to implement a function that returned true if a linked list had a cycle in it. After filling out and returning the document I was setup for a phone interview with the team. During the phone interview I was asked some soft questions about my interests in technology, background, etc. I was also asked how I would implement a function to convert a character array into an integer. I was told I would be hearing from them again. The next day the recruiter emailed me to setup an in person interview in Redmond, Washington. On the day of the interview I went to the wrong building and ended up barely making my interview time. Tip - arrive early! *Interviewer 1 - SDET: Soft questions about background, then jumped into a coding question. How would I reverse words in a paragraph of text. I coded it out and he pointed out a bug, which I fixed. *Interviewer 2 - Lead SDE: Jumped right into a coding question. There's a tree where in addition to the left/right pointers, there's another pointer set to NULL. I was to write a function to traverse the tree, initializing that pointer to the nodes sibling. So basically just connecting up the levels of the tree. *Interviewer 3 - Lead SDET: Print tree level by level. I coded up a solution in 10 minutes and ran some test cases through it. He then sold me on his team. *Interviewer 4 - Lead SDET: No coding question. The entire interview was me writing a test plan to test a robot. *Interviewer 5 - Development Manager: Some chit chat about resume, then a coding question. Print the count of letters in an array. So if the array was "ababac", I would print a - 3, b - 2, c - 1. After the interview the manager said I would hear from them soon. Next day I was given an offer, contingent on a background check.

I was contacted by a Microsoft college recruiter. I initially applied for a Software Development Engineer Intern Position but because I was in my last year of my Master's degree the interviewer told me that I can't apply for an internship position because after the internship I wouldn't be going back to school anymore. So she decided to interview me anyway but consider me for a fulltime position. I wasn't sure if I want to move from my country to the States so I guess this thing was a major black ball for me (I guess). After all the questions were related to the projects I listed on my resume. She asked what was the most technically challenging project I worked for in the past. I didn't review enough my projects because I didn't have enough time and because mostly of them were OS &kernel related and I mostly forgot how I did them and what were the major problems that I had to overcome. So an advice would be to review all the interesting projects that you did in the past in order to answer rapidly and accurately about them. I think this was the major reason that I didn't get an onsite interview (bacause the interviewer couldn't make a clear idea about the projects that I did).

I interviewed as a senior in college. The interviewing process consisted of two phases for me: (1) a single on-campus interview when Microsoft visited my college campus, and (2) a day-long on-site interview at Microsoft's campus in Redmond. The on-campus interview was with an engineer and consisted of some simple technical questions. We also talked a bit about some programming projects I had worked on at school. I believe they were looking for basic technical chops and enthusiasm for engineering. The on-site interview consisted of one interview with an HR person and 4 interviews with engineers (two from one product/team, and two from a completely different product/team). The interview with the HR person was non-technical and focused on why I was interested in becoming an engineer. The interviews with engineers were all technical in nature. They mostly consisted of programming and algorithms questions of moderate difficulty --- the usual affair. I also had lunch at some point with one of the engineers I ended up interviewing with. One of the technical interviews was fairly nonstandard. I was asked to come up with a design (hardware/software) for a robotic telescope. The question was very open-ended, though the interviewer of course gave some guidance. I believe the purpose of the question was to gauge the ability of the candidate to design a (real-world) system.

I was placed into the Employee Referral Program after being referred by a friend who works there. Two recruiters contacted me within a week to set up a telephone interview. I was then invited for an on-site interview within two weeks. The scheduling process was very disorganized and I was not informed until the day before my interview about my schedule. The on-site interview process itself was cloaked in mystery and I was not told how many interviews I would have during the day. Like I read somewhere, in spite of being interviewed by multiple people, you get to make only one first impression because the every interviewer passes on his views to the next interviewer. If your first interview goes badly, the following interviewers will have a poor impression of you even before you meet them. The interviewers were cordial and asked mentally stimulating questions. The questions were a good mix of problem-solving and analytic thinking. Overall, I was impressed by the interviewers and enjoyed my conversations with them, but frustrated by everything else (recruiters, schedulers, etc)

Not expecting much I went along with the process and spoke the recruiter and then another one. Finally I was setup with a phone-screen by the hiring manager which was pretty straightforward with a few questions about basic algorithms etc. After which I was asked to fly in to Redmond at Microsoft's expense which seemed like a sin to turn down. Flew upto Seattle from California the day before and was put up in a pretty nice 4-star place in Redmond. Microsoft goes all out in taking care of its candidates, very professional indeed. The whole next day was spent in the Microsoft campus with various 1-on-1 meetings starting with a new Recruiter and then every one else was either an engineer or a Manager. Each interview seemed to focus on a different type of questioning including Algorithms, coding, white-boarding, transactions, process, deployment etc. It was a very well rounded interview process and did not focus on just 1 kind of questioning like other companies. Finished the day feeling pretty confident about my performance and to my surprise got a call from the recruiter the very same night with a verbal offer !

First half of the interview consisted of general questions about my projects and what I was working on. The second part was technical and he asked me a really simple question: Calculate factorial recursively. I coded on a piece of paper and spoke out loud the steps. And also wrote the special case checks and stuff. Then he asked the test cases and I gave the test cases(-ve numbers, characters,etc). Then he asked the complexity of the algorithm, where I stumbled a bit. But he helped me in that and we came up with the answer O(n). After that, I didn't hear from Microsoft in 3-4 weeks. I sent an email to the recruiter after 2 weeks without reply. On the 4th week, I was anxious, as I had an onsite interview with another company and emailed again. I got a reply that I was rejected :(

Microsoft came to my college's career fair, and I dropped off my resume with them there after talking to the college recruiter for awhile. About a week later I had an on campus interview. The interview was a about 10 minutes of talking about myself and what I wanted to do, and then he asked me to code a question about strings in c. After this they emailed me about to weeks later and asked me to come on site for the second round interview. They flew me up to Seattle all expenses paid, and put me up in a nice hotel. The actual second round was for me a series of 4 interviews. I was told there would be any number between 3-5 interviews depending on what they wanted to see. The team I worked with seemed very laid back and relaxed. They didn't really seem to care whether I had the most correct answer or not as long as they could see what I was thinking. Overall it was a very positive experience.

Interview was via campus recruitment. I have had several interviews with various companies/government identities and this was definitely different from what I had experienced before. Most of my other interviews the interviewer gets to know you a little bit, may have a few questions about the work experience in your resume, mainly to get you to talk. This was different in the sense where there wasn't much of "Tell me about yourself, your experience, etc". It was more along the lines of "This is what I do. This is what software development is, this is what software testing is". Then from there went on to discussing a problem where you have a function with 3 string parameters. You basically have to design the search and replace function. While doing so he throws in scenarios that may cause your code to break and you have to react to those scenarios. Anything from replacing the word "ball" with "baseball" or replacing the word ball with "ballballballball ball ball ballball", etc. You get to ask a couple of questions about the company and that was it. It seemed like to me that they had a person with specific skillset in mind and were going straight for that rather than looking for students in general interested in microsoft that may have a place in MS.

Given the time to prepare, it would have been an easy interview, but some of us are not actively looking and, need time to brush up on some basics. Overall a good learning experience.

Had a screening interview on campus. Was asked about my coursework and why I applied for the position. Was asked some theory questions related to my coursework, and then about my favourite software and hardware products and how I would improve them. I was then called back for an onsite interview in Seattle, Washington. I met with 4 members of the same team: SDET, Dev, and then the PM. The interviews were all 1 hours long, except for the lunch interview which was 1.5 hours. These set of interviews were hard, and getting the right answer wasn't the point as they would provide additional constraints and you would have to come up with another answer.

I was a contractor at Microsoft before, and had many interviews there over the years. After my previous QA manager at Microsoft passed my resume on to the hiring HR for a SDET position with a different team, I had an interview with the HR personnel. She then sent me a list of questions to answer for the hiring team to review. Most of these questions are about testing strategy and how one would approach testing... After I submitted my answers, HR followed up with me a couple of days later to schedule for a technical phone interview with the hiring manager. The phone interview went about an hour, and the hiring manager asked me to do some coding and send it to him through email. A few days later, HR let me know the team chose to move on with different candidates. The whole process was professionally done. I believe whoever could show strong passion, good knowledge, and last but not least well fit in with the hiring team will get the job.

Round one was at the University on campus. They ask you a small coding question. After I passed round one, they flew me out to Bellevue, Washington. You stay at a hotel with other engineers that are going to be interviewed. A bus takes you to the Microsoft campus to be interviewed. The interview at Microsoft consisted of five one hour interviews. All of the interviews included coding questions. I think the tricky part of the interview was the language barrier. English is my first language; it was not the first language of one of the interviewers. I think he was upset that I kept asking him to repeat himself.

I made a general submission on Microsoft's career site. About two months later, a Microsoft recruiter contacted me and asked me some general questions about my background. She then directed me to another recruiter who asked me if I would be interested for a position on the MSN team. I said I was interested, and a few days later, she set up a phone interview with the hiring manager. The phone interview was completely technical. I had to write code in a Live Meeting session. First I was asked to write some very basic HTML and CSS. Then I was asked to code up a problem that was recursive in nature. I struggled a little bit, but was able to come up with a solution in the end. A few days later, my recruiter told me that Microsoft wanted to fly me to Seattle for an on-site interview. A week later, I flew out for a day of interviewing. My interview consisted of three one-hour interviews, and one 1.5-hour interview that included lunch. My first interviewer had me code up a pretty standard problem on the whiteboard. As I coded it up, she asked me questions about what I was doing and how efficient my code was. My final code was not very efficient, but that turned out to be okay as she was just looking to see how I think. She also asked me to describe a time where I solved a hard coding problem on my own. My second interviewer had me design the classes that would be required for a CSS parser that would ultimately try to compress a CSS file by merging redundant selectors. Most of my time was spent designing the basic data structures and explaining how I would go about merging selectors. Again, he was just looking to see how I think. My third interview consisted of a one-hour lunch followed by a half-hour whiteboard coding session. The lunch portion was pretty casual where we mostly talked about what I've worked on in the past. The coding portion was pretty standard. I struggled a bit, but that turned out to be okay. I was told ahead of time that the fourth interview was contingent on how well the first three interviews went. So I was happy when I was told that I would have a fourth interview. The fourth and final interviewer was an old man who was higher up on the ladder. The interview was very laid back. He asked me questions like why I wanted to work at Microsoft, how long I intended to stay, and if I plan to pursue higher education. It was my impression that if you make it to the fourth interview, it's already been decided that you're technically capable of working at Microsoft. Now it was time to see if you had the right personality to work there. Two weeks later, my recruiter called me up with an offer. Overall, very positive experience. Every interviewer was very nice. They all tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible, giving me helpful hints when I started to struggle with a coding problem. They were definitely more interested in how you think than the final code that ends up on the whiteboard. Perfection is not required.

I had three interviews after flying out to Seattle. 1) The first interview was a coding question in which I was asked a puzzle. The question was you have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. you make 100 passes by the doors starting with the first door every time. the first time through you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, you open it, if its open, you close it). the second time you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6). the third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9), etc, until you only visit the 100th door. I was told I could answer the question using code and so I did by brute force. I coded it very well and the interviewer guided me through it. 2) The second interview was a regular Q & A situation in which I was asked the usual questions about problems I've faced how I solved them etc. 3) The third interview was over lunch and I was asked to test a number of things such as a PC, a ketchup packet. I didn't do so well in this one.

I attended for a two-day on-site interviews for two different groups. The first day interview went very well. The second day was okay (I did not get offer from this team, which is very obvous) The very first thing I want to mention about the microsoft interview process is that all the employees who interviewed me are very down to earth candidates. Almost at all times, they were either trying to help me or asking some plain questions.. there is no show off of their knowledge. I felt very relieved compared to my previous experience at other companies like Google, Amazon etc. All the interviewers are very friendly, they did not make any facial expressions or anything like that.. which made me feel that this is the place I should be working at. During the on-site interviews the candidate is scheduled for a definite three 1:1 interviews, if the candidate is good enough then more interviews will be conducted and finally you will happen to meet the hiring manager. All the questions I was asked are data strucure related problem solving questions and simple test cases. Writing code on white board is bit tough for anyone, but practice makes you perfect. They are no longer asking any puzzles :).

Microsoft's infamous "interview loop"- three one-hour-ish interviews with current MSFT employee's, followed by another interview with a general manager. Interview structure is nothing peculiar: standard algorithm construction on a white-board, general programming knowledge questions, prior group development experience, etc. If you only know Java, you're pretty applying for the wrong job.

There were 3 interviews. 1st Interview : Ran short of time, I was asked about problem using hash table algorithm which I answered eventually after couple of prompts. 2nd interview was lunch interview, where I was told to code on paper. It was optimized search algorithm. I was told to optimize the code for speed. This round was good and my performance was good. Then some behavioral questions were thrown by the interviewer Then the last interview is where I screwed it up: I was told to optimize a url address by parsing it and going back a folder if a "/../" string is encountered. I was told to code on the board with a timer. Interviewer told me to implement the code in 10 mins, covering all possible test cases. I started off with wrong data structure and missed some test cases. End of the interview ,I was told " Good Luck with your Job Search".

Since this was for a team in St paul, I had 2 rounds of phone screens. One from the hiring manager in St paul and one from the test lead in Redmond. both of them went well and I was asked to come onsite to St Paul. there I had 4 rounds of interviews which ended with a meeting with the director. It was great to talk to people who had so much passion about the stuff they are building. Once the interviews were done, I was called onsite to redmond for another day of interviewing. There, I met the Test Lead, a Senior SDET and another director who sole me completely on the product and the features. That was enough for me to make up my mind to join Microsoft ( if i was made an offer that is :) ). Fortunately, I was made an offer and I accepted it.

I interviewed with Microsoft for an internship through my university's co-op system. The interview itself was a 45 min technical interview plus a 15 min "feel-good" session with an HR person. The technical interview was fairly standard; they asked me to solve an algorithm question. With the HR person I discussed my preferences for location and type of development work I preferred. I later received an offer via e-mail, and was put into contact with a team in Redmond. The recruiter was very helpful even during weekends and was accommodating when I asked to talk to the team again. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the organization of their interview process. I turned down their offer, however, because I got a very interesting internship offer from a start-up.

Had one short interview on campus, then after 3 months got a phone call for the interview on phone plus had to fill out a pretty boring/long form asking me about my interesting projects etc. First interview was easy; mostly HR stuff, then they sent me a online test, two questions first was to implement FIFO using LIFO second was on the lines of selecting random nodes from a tree. 2nd question was pretty tough. But I did both of them in 1 hour, compiled and send them the working code. Then they called up for a technical interview asking following questions -How would you test an application that takes 3 inputs and draws a triangle? (black box testing) -Write a data structure class that works as both a Stack and a Queue. Write test cases for them. -Write code to reverse a linked list. Write test cases. -Write code to merge-sort 2 linked lists (no duplicates). Write test cases. -Write code to delete all nodes in a linked list that contain integer values that are odd numbers. Write test cases. -Write code to delete alternate nodes in a doubly linked list. Write test cases. - Given "ABC/EF" where do you place values G, H, and I. (pattern matching puzzle). -How will you write a function to merge two sorted arrays assuming one of them have enough space to hold all the members. After this they called me up to MS’s EU headquarters in Ireland, pretty basic interview, back to back 5 interviews, all pretty easy, asking questions about C++ internals, pointers and few simple algorithms, search a list, sort an array, overloading etc. After this (i.e. after about 10 interviews in total and 1 coding test) they precede with an offer the next day, which was sadly only €30K amazingly a very low offer from such a big company. I discussed with the Microsoft’s HR abut the growth prospects what will be my pay after 1 year and then 2 year, turned out its pretty basic, 36-37K after first year and 40-42K after 2nd. I also applied at Accenture; they offered 42K + benefits straight away. So I can’t believe it, but I had to ditch Microsoft and join Accenture. In the end I felt that Microsoft wasted so much of my time, not worth apply a job here. My advice is if you are smart and can make it, join Google. Otherwise go for the money, there is no prestige in working for MS anymore.

Applied and interviewed through the school and at school facilities. The interviewer that was assigned wasn't relevant to my experience, and the questions I received weren't relevant at all to my postgraduate study. The process consisted of: attending a tech session, where the resume was submitted to the recruiter; the recruiter requesting a copy of the resume by email and providing some forms to fill in; and the actual interview on school facilities with a Microsoft engineer, who was not at all familiar with the area I would like to have been considered for (I am interested in operating systems). The engineer seemed quite boring, and I'm wasn't all that interested in Microsoft either, so I was not too surprised that I was not selected for the second round of interviews.

Initial communication: referred by an employee and got word from a staffing agent that they were looking for a match. Once I was in the system, it took about 2 weeks for me to hear from the interested groups. Phone screen: "Tell me how you would do this" kind of interview questions. All phone interview questions were pertinent to the work that the group did...no oddball questions. After 2 days, I was invited for an onsight interview. On-site interview: I interviewed with two groups. Started at 8am, and it lasted through dinner (taken out by prospective manager) until about 9pm. The interview process was done in famous Microsoft style: the applicant visits various future colleagues in their offices, they ask questions to probe your intelligence, they make a decision, and when handing you off to the next interview, inform that interviewer of what they asked along with their initial impressions. There were no "why are manhole covers round" type of questions. Most were coding questions (boring & don't measure intelligence in my opinion), and there were a few math questions (probability & statistics). I observed that the work environment really depends on the team dynamics. Each group is a little fiefdom that competes with other groups. Of the 2 groups, I had no interest in joining one of them, and was very attracted to the other group. Unfortunately, the group that I wanted to be in deliberated, but decided not to extend an offer. The final process took 2 days. I had initial salary negotiations with the hiring agent: ballpark of 100K salary (I have a PhD) and up to 20K bonus per year...plus the fabulous Microsoft benefits package. In the end, I got a more family friendly (and more lucrative) job elsewhere.

Have one of your buddy to take your interview 2-3 times, this will help you evaluate whether you really remeber things or go blank when you have demonstrate to somebody. There were 2 more internal candidates came for the interview before the team made me the offer. If you don;t make through they will tell you in 1 - 2 days.

Got the interview from speaking with an engineer at a university career fair. During the interview, I was asked about my undergraduate courses. He asked what my favorite class was. I've heard from other students that they've also been asked the same question. The interviewer went over the different available positions they were hiring for, and he went through a quick form about which positions I would be interested in. After some general background and interest questions, he asked me to solve a coding problem on a white board. I personally found the setup pretty intimidating with the interviewer staring at the back of my head, but the question wasn't too bad. The question was as follows: Given two strings, how would you remove from the first string all the characters which appear in the second string. I thought I did decently well and the interviewer seemed satisfied. Overall, the interview was so-so, but not extraordinary.

I was taken to 5 different interviews with 5 different professionals working at different areas in the bing search group. Each interview started with the person describing what kind of work they do at Microsoft, then asking me about my work / research, and finally asking me some questions that would test my skills on solving problems. The idea was to see how I approached the problem, not the solution itself. Problems were mostly puzzles that involved some sort of optimization.

I had a phone interview with an HR person first and he asked me a few simple behavioral questions and a bunch of technical questions. I heard back from Microsoft after about a month saying I had cleared the phone interview and was invited to interview in Redmond,Seattle. I had 6 rounds of technical interviews. I thought I did well on all of them except for the last one. I heard back from them within a week saying I was rejected but they acknowledged that I had come very close to getting hired.

It was on campus interview. 5 rounds total, including 2 written. Main focus was algorithms, data structures and programming.

Microsoft has smart engineers and they want to work with other smart engineers. They mainly test your ability to design clever algorithms on a whiteboard under pressure. When you are writing up your answer the key is to just keep talking, tell them what you are thinking, Even if you don't have the answer yet just keep talking to let them see your process. As long as you can do some basic coding on the whiteboard and show them that you have an actual thought process behind it you should be ok.

The phone interview was easy enough. Typical questions like writing a function to print out the Nth Fibonacci number and how to test a calculator. MS then invited me to Redmond for an on-site interview three weeks later. I was confident up until the third interviewer, who was more confrontational than the rest. The fourth interviewer took me to the employee cafeteria on the top floor for lunch, and later back to his office for more questioning. I was exhausted by the time I finally met the fifth and final interviewer, and made plenty mistakes that ultimately led to a no offer. As this is a SDET position, the interview questions were consisted of mostly coding questions and how to test them, with a brief discussion on design pattern (explain singleton), and one puzzle (divide the clock into segments using two lines so that the numbers in segment add up to the same sum.)

I had a 60 minute screening phone interview with a recruiter on one day. This interview consisted of the basic HR-type questions (legal resident, brief review of resume, etc). The next day I had a 60 minute technical phone interview with the hiring manager. This was more involved, dealing more with C# experience, application experience, and past projects that required software testing. Approximately two weeks after the phone interviews I traveled to Fargo for an all-day in-person interview. This day I met with 7 or 8 people, including the recruiter, position peers, the hiring manager, and finally the product manager. In total the interviews went for 7 hours including a working lunch. Peers were focused on C# knowledge. A lot of C# knowledge. There were a lot of programming examples to hand-code on a white board. The managers were more focused on past application experience, how much I had worked with their specific product, and how much I had worked on other similar products.

Contacted by a recruiter. Had a preliminary 'skills phone interview' (how long using x technology)... I was honest basically saying 15 years C++, but < 6 on the web and C# front. Was called in for a day interview. I was told I would meet with three people. After my third interview (lunch), I was taken to meet with two other people, then walked to the door. On the surface, the interview was more or less normal. These guys were experienced software developers who were some nice, some grumpy, some arrogrant, some sociable, some not. Normal. They ask me what I'm working on, some questions about my past, then I ask what they're working on, and then each interviewer asked a technical question, it seemed like because they knew they were supposed to because it's microsoft. The questions were hard, but it wasn't as nitpicky as I feared, and after working through the problems I felt like I came to reasonable solutions. But I didn't get an offer, so maybe they didn't feel the same? Honestly several of these problems I would have answered by classifying the algorithm, looking it up on wikipedia and coding. My last interview with the senior staff member was the worst. He didn't seem very interested in my answers. He asked if I wanted to change any of my answers to previous interviewers, as if somehow their were 'right' and 'wrong' answers, I guess. Sticking to who you are and what you do best is the wrong way? He asks if I have any questions, but then provides non answers to the ones I ask, so I say no, I can't think of any. I asked about work life balance and got the distinct impression that I was way out of bounds. Now that I think about it, I don't feel really good about the experience. Between all the emailing between interviews, the trading info, the puzzles, and the trick questions, it seemed more like trying out for a game show than a job. I believe this guys were reducing me to a zero or one (hire/no hire), and their questions were being taylored to make their decision. It was not about trying to understand who I am and what I could bring to the table. So I answer that I prefer references over pointers and I am a no hire? Immature at best. In that regard, a bad experience. Be prepared to be underestimated, under-respected and not seen. After putting it out there for this kind of experience you will inevitably end up feeling like a fool. Why do they use a process like this? One has to wonder about the experience working there if this is the recruitment setup. One guy intimated that they work pretty crazy hours there, so I suspect a big part of the interview was trying to find someone M$ could own. Not me I guess, though the technology was tempting. I would have tried it, I admit. The recruiter was on time with the no offer news (5 days), the best part about the interview (though I did enjoy talking to a couple of the guys). It worked out, I guess.

In 1965, Edsger Dijkstra set an examination question on a synchronization problem where five computers competed for access to five shared tape drive peripherals. Soon afterwards the problem was retold by Tony Hoare as the dining philosophers problem.

The process started with submitting resume at career fair, then had a on-campus interview. Basic questions were asked about projects etc, followed by writing code for a simple problem. After 2 weeks got a call for on-site interview. Was told there would be 3-5 interview in Redmond office with Live Search Data Mining group. The recruiter had no idea how different the interview process would be compared to SDE position. As such i brushed up on my research more than the algo+data structure parts. On the day of the interview, I arrived early in the morning and went over simple hr type questions ie. why msft, why would i choose them over others etc. I was given the name of the my first interview and told that each interview would take me to the next one (depending on how well i did). Also the interviewers would discuss the area they covered in the interview and how i performed with the next interviewer (and have me sit in the lobby when the discussed this). The first interviewer was the dev lead and went over my resume, ask some questions about my projects then saw that i had TA for cryptography a while back at school, so asked me to design a card game online where the player cannot cheat. this was followed by a prob. question and to write code for it. After that he took me to the next interview. This person too was a senior member of the team. He asked another algo/coding question, which i barely managed to get done in the time we had. Next interview was lunch interview, this is 1.5 hrs compared to previous 1hr ones. He went in lot more detail about my research work and what they do. This was followed by a couple of simple coding question when we got back to his office, but i performed quite poorly there. After that he took me to the next interview, this started with a simple coding question which he made progressively harder till i was stuck. After i was done he said this was my last interview of the day and he accompanied my outside to the recruiting shuttle. He basically said even though this position involved research, coding part is more important, and i didn't perform as well. After i went back to the recruiting building, the recruiter wasn't there but had left a packet of info about Seattle (based on a survey i had to fill in before the interviews). After 2 days i got back a mail from the recruiter that there would be no offer. All the coding questions i was asked were standard and available on various ms/google questions site (which i didn't prepare as well on). Also just don't solve the questions there, think about all possible follow up questions, can you improve it space/time, would caching/ locality help, special cases (uniform distribution of numbers etc).

Phone interview about general work history led to in person meeting. Question asked: In a given string find the last unique character. My answer was to filter out special cases (empty string, null string, blank string, single character string...) Some of this required firming up requirements (e.g. What do you return with a null string?) Interviewer's eyes rolled when I asked this and I was told to not worry about it, just code the answer. The actual coding was to be done on a whiteboard. My solution was to start from the end of the string and loop backwards. For each character compare the first index position against the last index position of the same character. If first and last index positions were the same the character was unique. Since I started from the end of the string the first time this happened was the last unique character. When that happened you dropped out of the loop and returned the answer. I was told that this was wrong. The way to do it was to run through the loop and hash the characters and keep track of the current last hash created. When you finished the loop the last hash created was the last unique character. We talked about the big O values of each method Overall the interview was difficult. The interviewer gave the impression their time was being wasted right from the start.

Some very theoretical questions on formal database and OO concepts. Questions were: how to do so-and-so in a linked list. Algorithm to come out of a maze given that you cannot turn left, or how to do recursive queries, some C questions, etc.

I gave my resume to one of the recruiters who came to our college and they setup a phone interview with me. It took about 45-60 minutes and the interviewer asked me questions about linked lists, arrays and one brain teaser. After that i was scheduled for an on-site interview. I spoke with 2 managers and 2 developers from Remote Desktop group and i did 90 percent of the questions. However Microsoft was laying off people and they stopped a lot of positions before i went there. Remote Desktop department is not what i was going to see but i ended up seeing them. Finally 1.5 weeks later i got a letter saying that they cant offer anything

I had a ridiculous experience. The first time my interview was scheduled the interviewer never called. I panicked and tried to get back to my recruiter but it turned out she was out of office (no auto-responses through her email). I sent multiple emails but received no response. Finally I decided to call. I didn't have her phone number as she never disclosed it. I was able to speak with her by using their automated system and mentioning her name. Another interview was scheduled. This interviewer was strongly biased towards SDE/T positions. He asked me why I applied for an SDE position and not SDE/T. I gave my explanation and was told the same could apply to SDET therefore I should really consider SDE/T. I said ok, but I like SDE (matter of personal choice really). After a lot of chatting about stuff like this we finally arrived at the technical questions. I was asked to return the longest palindrome in a given string. I was barely given 5 minutes (because most of the time was spent in explaining why SDET is kind of better as SDETs focus on code quality rather than just shipping a product). Further few minutes were given to test the code that I wrote. Btw, did I mention that I was supposed to write code in live meeting where there is no way you can edit the text you've typed? No indentation, nothing? (I couldn't figure it out, neither could my interviewer) After this, it took them over a month to reject me. The interviewer said 1-2 weeks. I was expecting so much from this. I wish it would have been different.

First, I had a 20 min on-campus screening interview at University. My experience doesn't seem that typical from talking to a lot of other candidates, or maybe it was only typical when Microsoft is hiring large groups (there were at least 50 candidates) for their $$ divisions. What happened next is after a 2 weeks, there was a callback to interview in Redmond. It was a planned day that started that was split in half from 9AM - 6PM. Half of the group started interviewing first, the other half had talks about how great working at Microsoft is. The actual interview process was 4 people, 45-min each with 15-min break in between. Fairly easy test questions on how to test (insert physical object/software part here) and also given some code to debug/show your approach to know when the code has been tested "sufficiently." At the end of the day, there is about an hour wait while interviewers deliberated and called dibs (multiple teams were interviewing) on the people they interviewed. Then all of us that got offers were called into a room to get presented with our managers who congratulated us and had a chat about the team, offer details, etc. My only advice is to relax, be methodical and organized in your testing of objects questions and breakdown all the problems, no matter how simple they seem - trust me.

How would you test (a physical object in the room or something else)? Totally unexpected when asked to tell them how you would proceed to test a spoon. This is to test your testing aptitude.   Answer Question

Following a phone interview I was invited to the Redmond campus for a long day of one-on-one interviews. Microsoft was gracious enough to pay all of my expenses for flying out to WA and eating/traveling. The 1:1 interviews themselves were interesting and difficult but often oddly focused: I felt as if the engineers who asked me questions usually were only interested in their own areas of study, and my knowledge or lack thereof in their (sometimes very different) fields didn't matter as much. For example, I had one interviewer ask me at the beginning of the interview if I had studied design patterns. I answered that while I had used some simple ones in the past, I have never formally studied them and thus don't know that many, nor the names of the ones I do know. Despite this, he continued to ask me questions for an hour about design patterns, and became visibly angry with me when I couldn't put names to the patterns he described. This probably boils down to typical engineer unsocial tendencies. The strangest part of the process is that you interview for a group within Microsoft that is chosen for you ahead of time without any of your own input. I ended up interviewing for a group that was doing work that did not interest me whatsoever, which made the process that much harder.

I was interviewing for an SDE position. I felt prepared for my interview. I left completely demoralized. The interviewers were certainly nice, and Microsoft does a great job of making sure that you are comfortable. They paid for the flight, lodging, food, rental car, etc. When I arrived, I spoke w/ an HR representative who seemed distant and unengaged with our conversation. My second interview was odd in the sense that the discussion focused entirely on arcane aspects of SQL and some generic problem solving. That was fine, but then he posed a string interpolation problem on the whiteboard and asked me to write an algorithm... I am a-ok with problem solving, but I am one of the cerebral 'think it out' type of developers. Tossing ideas on a whiteboard isn't how I do things.... and I think the interviewer picked up on this. Ultimately, I came close to solving it, but I was feeling a bit pressured and out of my comfort zone. The third interview was with a very, very senior SDE who proceeded to grill me on c/c++, memory allocation, stack frames, register allocation, etc. While my resume reflected some commercial c/c++ experience, that was over 10 years ago.... since then I have focused almost entirely on java/.net and other languages. More importantly, the position I was interviewing for didn't require any c/c++ experience. The interviewer then chose to present a problem which involved the development of a 'move' algorithm for cribbage. This was another 'whiteboard' problem where given enough time, I could have solved it, but they really, really put the screws to you... and expect you to think on your feet... quickly. The last interview was a 'fluff' interview during lunch, and I could tell that the interviewer was just passing time. Another whiteboard problem followed where I had to develop a base-26 version of itoa(), which was simple enough.... but I messed up on a bit of syntax... The bottom line is that while I was certainly capable of solving any of the problems, the medium/platform they expect you to solve them is totally incompatible with my personal comfort zone. Am I smart enough to work at MS? Absolutely... I have over 20 years of industry experience using a variety of microsoft tools and platforms. I also have a proven track record of architecting, developing and delivering secure, high-volume websites and enterprise systems. This is no BS... I can do the job. However, there is a definite culture clash between MS and I. I have been told that other dev groups at MS are similar with their approach and style... which is why I will not be interviewing there anytime soon :)

I was asked a linked list question during the next interview and coded on a white board. The third interview was a lunch interview.

The forth interview was a higher level question about a 12 sided di and how many colors it took to color it. The last interview was with a tester who just asked a few 'get to know you' questions including why should I hire you. Overall a good experience.

I was contacted by a Microsoft recruiter sometime in early February of 2007. She said she found my CV on the MS website and wanted an update version of it. So I sent it. After two weeks she scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview consisted of several qestions, technical and non-technical. A sample non-technincal question: "How many ballons would fit into the room you are right now?" ... typical Microsoft questions. They sent me a message that I passed the phone interview and if I agree to have a full day interview in Copenhagen, all expenses paid. Of course I said. I arrived in Copenhagen on a chilli February day, checked in at a hotel close to the MDCC (Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen) campus. At this point I must tell you that this campus IS NOT in Copenhagen, it is somewhat 30km up-North in a quiet suburb. Right now I live in the center of Copenhagen and it takes almost a full hour to reach the campus by public transport (don't even think of getting a car in Denmark ... the tax on it is 180% of it's value...) Anyway, the actual interview went ok, first were the HR people that asked me general questions like where do you see yourself in 5 years and so on ... then followed 4 managers from different teams. Most of them had some sort of technical programming questions and questions related to Test (I applied for an SDE in Test position). Overall, I think the interview went fine ...

I was sent a schedule of three interviews. The first two would be one hour and the third would be 90 minutes, which included a lunch. He said that if the first three interviews went well, they would have me stay for two additional interviews. The recruiter said that they don't usually let candidates know about the other two interviews. #1: The interviewer was a lead-developer and very welcoming. He was extremely laid-back and low-pressure. He asked me the traditional "what would you do if..." and I was given plenty of time to have him answer my questions. The problem given to me was that of rebuilding a FAT table after it had been deleted. The interviewer drew some shapes to represent bytes of data and went through the problems setup before I started. I walked away from this interview thinking that if everyone I met was only half as cool as this guy, that Microsoft would definilty be the place for me. He was sharp, had great people skills, and sold me on the company. #2: The interviewer was a senior SDET. This is where things started going bad. He was definitely all business and was definietly a high strung type of personality (that's the impression I got from my hour with him). He gave me two problems. The first was to code the game Battleship and the second was to code a program that would return the least amount of coins, like the automated change machines you see in grocery stores. The program would accepts an array of denominations and an amount to dispense. So, for example, you would calculate the number of coins to give back for 67 cents, and the denominations could be anything, not just the traditional 25, 10, 5, and 1. He could ask for the change using coin denominations such as 12, 5, and three. The goal was to return the smallest number of coins. Well, he was a little condescending and mistook some of my relief when he changed the rules of the problem for cockiness. I explained to him that I was relieved that he had made the scenario easier, not that I thought it was necessarily easy, just easier. What really struck me as unprofessional though was the fact that he was chomping away on some snacks as I worked out the problems. He was chewing loud enough that the crunching of whatever he was eating was not only distracting, but said to me that he didn't take me seriously enough to just focus on me, he had to eat his food too. This is when I started to think ,maybe this isn't the place for me. #3: The interviewer was a lead SDET. We had lunch and talked. It's a little awkward to eat and try to talk, but it went well enough. Most of the interview was casual conversation with a few official business questions tossed into the mix. When we got back to the office, she had me solve a problem that consisted of building a funtion that would determine if one string was the substring of another. You were basically recreating the standard .NET substring function, but were not allowed to use any of the built-in framework functions that did the substring for you. She was great to talk with, and she too sold me on what a great company MS was to work for and had me thinking the same again. She was able to reverse the negative impression of the last interview. #4: Here's where it all fell apart. I don't know what this last guy's job title was, but "jerk" would be fitting enough. To start with, he honestly looked like he was about to fall asleep. There were severa; times where it looked like he dozed off and awoke as I started to respond to his question. He was extremely condescending, arrogant, and short with me. Even if my first three interviews had convinced me to work at MS, his interview was such a negative experience for me that I have scratched them from my companies that I want to work for in the future. The first problem he gave me I honestly can't remember. I just remember him finally giving out a sigh of frustration and telling me tersely, "let's do another one since I basically did that one for you." The second was a traditional graph with an x and y axis. I was instructed to draw ten lines, the ten best lines for testing the graph. After that he changed the scenario a little, and I was told to add any lines needed to further test the graph considering the new conditions, but I would have to remove some of the existing lines, since I would only have ten. Well, at the end of this miserable experience, he told me that he was going to get my next interviewer. I was offer a drink and sat in the lounge for several minutes as he passed by a couple times. He then came over and said "well, I guess that's it for today. Thanks." I left that day with mixed feelings about working for them. They decided that my people skills were great, but that my technical skills were lacking. I view it as dodging a bullet.

I applied online through the Microsoft website and was contacted a few days later through email by a HR company. This email had arranged several campus interview dates and asked me to list the times I was available. At the interview I met with a Manager of a Software Development Engineer in Test. He took casual to an extreme, and was noticeably tired and uninterested. He had been interviewing candidates all day. He asked two logic based questions.

The recruiter was aggressive, he painted pretty pictures of new features and cool new technologies I would be working on, but in reality, I did over a year of bugfixing on a mature technology nearing maintenance stage. I was interviewed by 7 people overall, from 10am up to 6pm in the evening when I had the final conversation with the recruiter. The interview questions were not too hard, I got some usual questions on linked lists and trees. Other questions were mostly about hardware and low-level drivers. I wasn't asked any puzzles that MS was once famous for, but I got several interesting questions about emulating an old console game on modern hardware and about avoiding issues with problematic hardware.

The hiring process consisted of an initial phone screen. There never really was any technical phone interview. I believe that at this level, the companies mainly want to gague if the individual is interested in the job or not. The on-site interview was also quite interesting. Quite a few very senior people in the organization interviewed me and the questions were not the typical run of the mill questions. Instead the questions pertained to the problems that the interviewers were working on at that point in time. At the very end of the day, i got a chance to meet the VP and spend an hour with him. This was very encouraging.

For the SDIT role, they focus on how you think and the basic fundamentals of Data Structures: linked list, search, graphs, tree.. etc, and some behavior questions. I have a couple of interviews at the Redmond campus, and at the end of the day, I felt I've been brain picked for a whole week. Normally, the on site interview will be conducted by at least three person, and at least two of the three will give technical interview where the other person will give behavior questions. Some of the questions are not difficult, but it's hard when you have to write a program in the white board and within certain time limit. Good luck!

The process started with a screening interview by phone where the recruiter asked questions related to the resume and some basic technical questions like what's the difference between c++ and java. After that I went through 4 or 5 technical 1:1 interviews with different people of different groups inside MS, like office, printing, etc. The 1:1 interviews consisted of producing an algorithm to solve specific problems which required the use of data structures and general programming skills. Be prepare to defend your algorithm in terms of performance (asymptotic notation) and corner cases. One of the most important things to do during the process is to _verbalize_ your thoughts during the creation of your algorithm/design.

The phone interview consisted of a 1 hour pre screen phone conversation. It started off by the interviewer asking basic questions about some of the things listed on my resume. After that, the interviewer asked deeper into some of the projects I worked on, and moved onto more specific technical questions about my skills in programming in C++. Finally I was asked a technical brain teaser question.

I was asked to write an algorithm in C++ to sort an array. The function I was to write was to take in a string of letters "b" and "r". b = a red ball and r = a blue ball. The function was to return an integer with the least number of swaps needed to separate the balls to be next to their own colors... So for example, RBBR would return 1, since you only need to swap one of the letters to be RRBB or BBRR.   Answer Question

Well, first of all I attended a job fair at my college, Arizona State University, where I handed my resume to Microsoft. I was then called in to the school career center for my first interview. I was so nervous but I was able to answer the questions I was asked even though I didn't finish writing the code, he saw my thought process and he agreed that given the time, I could code the solution. A few weeks later, I received an email to set a date for an in-person interview. I arrived in Seattle and went for my interview the next day. On getting to Microsoft, I met some other candidates who were also interviewing that day. We all were in the receiving area playing with the surface, xbox guitar hero and some other games. I had applied for an internship but asked them right there to change it to a job and I was told that I might not get the best fit. Thinking back, I guess I should have stuck with the internship. I met with three people on that day, all about an hour each except the third which was about an hour and half because of the lunch. I was asked some tough questions and I was able to answer some really well, and others not so well. Overall, it was a good interviewing experience but I was so drained at the end of the day.

msft has two rounds. 1st round is usually on-campus. Recruiters usually come to campus multiple times throughout the year. It's always not a big deal if you miss once - because they'll always come back again in a month or so. 1st round is half an hour. Usually 5 min behavioral and the rest is tech. Depends on how fast you are and the actual recruiter, the number of questions being asked could range from 1 to 5. It takes about 1-3 weeks to hear from the recruiter about the result of the 1st round. Then they'll schedule an on-site interview with you. Usually you can choose four dates in the next coming month and they'll finalize one. They'll fly you to seattle (or other location you chose) and take care of all expense (hotel, transporation, meals etc). The on-site interview takes one-full day from around 8:15am to roughly 4pm. The actual length varies depends on your performance. Usually you'll be interviewing with two groups, one in the morning and one in the afternoon and there's a lunch interview in between. You'll meet 2-3 interviewers from each group. If you really screw up your morning interview there could be a chance that your afternoon interviews will be cancelled (they'll tell you your next interviewer is sick or something). You'll get an offer from the group only if all interviewers say yes and if one or more says no you won't get one. So that means you still have two chances (two groups). Each interview is 1on1 (95% of the time taking place in the interviewer's office) and takes about 1 hour. The interview consists of short behaviral questions and majority is about tech questions. You will be writing code on whiteboard. At the end of each interview, the interviewer will bring you to your next interviewer. They will exchange about questions already asked to you and your performance. If you make your way to see the dev manager in the end - the last interviewer, that means you are doing a decent job. If you don't even get to see the manager that means 99% likely you are already out. In the past it usually takes about 1 week after your on-site interview to hear about the result (could be longer if you don't get an offer). But now they expedite that to immediate result - you'll be asked to return to building 19 (it was optional in the past). And if your recruiter wants to see you that means you'll be hearing about an offer. And if you are told you can leave and wait for result, that possibly indicates a negative answer. Now they are experimenting new interview process which is more similar to Cisco's, which consists of 4 interviews which only take half a day, plus some site-seeing and presentations. The compensation is 80k (Software Development Engineer @ 89) base plus up to 20% bonus (realistically, less than 10%) plus stock options. Standard benefits - 401k, free insurance (health, dental, vision), ESPP and other misc stuff. It's lower b/c cost of living is a lot cheaper than bay area and the tax is a lot lower too. Relocation is 5k. You have 2 weeks to accept or decline the offer.

A couple days after the phone interview, an email arrived inviting me to Redmond for interviews. The day was a long one with 7 interviews in all. 5 of the 7 were technical interviews. One was more informational and the last was asking some behavioral questions. The technical interviews consisted of a coding problem, i.e. how to delete a node from a linked list.

It started with a referral from a friend. I was contacted by a recruiter and offered a phone interview, which I accepted. The phone interview took place within a week. The phone interviewer seemed to be technically capable of analyzing my answers. The phone interview questions varied between high-level design questions and low-level technical questions. Overall, she was cordial and happy to answer any questions i had. I was contacted within a couple days with an offer for the in-person interview. Apparently, they were trying out a new interview format where they bring in 30 or so candidates at a time, all to be interviewed on the same day. The interviews were still 1:1, but all interviews were conducted simultaneously, and the interviews were conducted at 45 minute intervals, with 15 minute breaks in between. It was a little different, but it allows us to socialize with each other and relax a bit before our next interview. After all interviews were finished, we sat through a couple product presentations, selling us on the products we might be working on. This occurred while the interviewers were making their decisions. We were told that all decisions would be made before we left, which was awesome. After the presentations, I was called out to a separate room along with a small group of other people. We were all given offers; I'm not sure about what happened to the others. I got to meet the manager of the group I was hired for (who also happened to be one of my interviewers), and we talked about various teams that I could choose to work with. All of the recruiters were very nice and happy to help out. All of the interviewers did their best to sell their teams to me. Overall, it was a great experience.

This was a contract position at Microsoft Hardware Software Team. I got contacted through a staffing agency that I worked with. First - I got some screening questions like these: 1.

What might happen if you do not write a virtual destructor for the base class? 3. Provide a *robust* function that will accept an array of integers and the length of the array, find the two largest even integers in the array, multiply them together, and return the result. Then they invited me for a series of 3 1:1 interviews at their location asking typical Microsoft interview questions, like - find duplicate items in unsorted lists plus some SQL questions like - how to list all addresses for all customers and how joins work between tables. For the skills - it is just best to know them and refresh some knowledge - scan through a book on the subject and review anything you might not know or always thought difficult in a particular area (like types of locks and locking levels in SQL). For algorithms - it would be a good idea to browse through computational complexity information for common data structures and algorithms (hashtables, binary trees) and try out some common questions (see http://www.careercup.com/). Also - be confident and show your real interest in the job - I might have shown I was not so much interested in that position, since I was looking for something a bit different. Now I am still looking and wondering whether I should have shown more enthusiasm for their work.

I got my first interview by persistently approaching Microsoft at my university's career fairs. My first interview was a typical screening interview, but face-to-face on campus instead of the usual phone interview. I was asked open-ended questions, such as how I would design an alarm clock for a blind person and what my favorite computer application was and why. The next stage of the interview process was a fly-out to Microsoft's headquarters for a full day's worth of interviewing. All the travel and lodging was paid for by Microsoft and was organized very well. I had a recruiter at Microsoft who was in charge of planning my interviews, talking with the interviewers and making the final hire decision. He was a bit pushy, but I can't say that's representative of all Microsoft recruiters. I got to the recruiting building in the morning and met my recruiter face-to-face with a few other students who were also interviewing for internships. We were given the name of our first interviewer and a description of their group and then shuttled off to different buildings to meet them. All the interviews took place in the interviewer's day-to-day office, which was nice because I got a chance to see their normal work place and get a feel for the company culture. Microsoft is actually very laid back compared to what I had imagined. There are no cubicles, all of the full-time employees get their own office. The dress is very casual, and the normal dress seems to be a polo shirt or t-shirt and jeans. I decided to dress business casual that day (a collared shirt tucked into khakis) even though everyone had told me to wear a suit. Even then, two of my interviewers commented about how dressed up I was! The building I interviewed in had an XBox lounge (they bought a Wii too later that summer) and a kitchen stocked with free coffee and soda on each floor. My first two interviews were about an hour each and were pretty standard technical interviews. My third interview went a bit longer because we went out for lunch and talked casually (although this was still considered part of the interview). When we came back from lunch, I still had to answer a technical question before I set off for my fourth interview. My first three interviews were all with the same team and took place in the same building, but my fourth interview was with a different team. At the end of the day, I went back to the recruiting building and waited for the results of my last interview to come back to my recruiter. I did well enough that I got offers from both teams I had interviewed. Note that my recruiter said that it usually takes about a week to make a decision on hire or no-hire for an intern, so this was an exception. However, this actually wasn't all too helpful because they still only gave me one week to make a decision! My recruiter really pushed me to make a decision as soon as possible but didn't respond to my emails for the first half of the week (in his defense, he was sick), so I pushed my decision a bit longer than a week. I wish I had been given more time to interview with other companies, but I didn't push my decision any further and decided to accept the offer (after all, it was a pretty good offer).

Connect Four is a game where two players take turns dropping their color discs into a vertically suspended grid. The game ends when a player adds a disc to the playing grid that connects four discs of their color. The connected discs can be in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. Write a function to be called after every turn that returns true if the game is over (and false otherwise).   3 Answers Write an algorithm that does an in-order traversal of a tree recursively. Now, write the same algorithm iteratively.   4 Answers

As a college student, Microsoft first came to my Campus to give me an interview, where they asked me a challenging programming logic question. I passed that interview, and they flew me to Seattle for an on-site interview. Over the course of a day, I had 4 interviews that were much like my on campus interview. At each interview, I was asked a technical question. From what I heard, it seemed that only about one out of every four people who are flown to Seattle will receive an offer.

You have a list of red and blue objects. You have to sort them using swapping in order N time.   1 Answer Given an inorder and preorder traversal of a binary tree, reassemble the tree.   Answer Question Given a set of people, one of them is a celebrity.

Very well thought out and organized. Questions were difficult but not too hard that you can't answer.

The most difficult questions were the technical ones. They consisted of programming questions to "how would you test this" questions.   Answer Question
