find longest palindrom from string, O(N) runtime   Answer Question

Nov 10, 2016
---------------
Write a function that given an array of numbers, return the highest occurrence of a number. Say 6 showed up the most (8 times) return 8. I over thought the question. This is in C and I'm guessing they just wanted a me to allocate a full array (256 for 8 bit) and +1 an entry whenever that number occurs (histo[number]++) while keeping the highest occurrence in a return variable if (histo[number] > highest) highest++;. I thought the solution was way too simple (like 6 lines tops) so I thought of a solution that would work for very large numbers for which a full array couldn't be allocated (64 bit = 2^64 array for instance). It wasn't as memory and computationally efficient as allocating a full array for lower bit number ranges (8, 16, 32) but it was a more robust and complete solution. Anyways, I guess he didn't see it that way. They turned me down. 8( So warning.. don't overthink a question on the phone interview. They're more likely to just want the 6 line quick answer on the phone interview. I think the phone interview is purely to weed out the complete idiots. If you overthink what they think is an easy problem then you look like a complete idiot. Onsite is be more challenging. I did the onsite a few years ago and the solutions and implementation required some thought.   Answer Question

Phone interview: Given an NxN matrix how would you print all elements in a spiral way starting from the middle element. Phone interview answer: 4 for loops with conditions. Onsite: Interviewer 1: Q1: Find all pairs of numbers that equal to a given sum in a given int array. My Answer: Put all in a HashSet and iterate over elements to find sum - current number is present or not and add that pair to the result. O(n) runtime. Q2: Find the longest sequence of integers in a given int array. My Answer: Maintain two lists. One holding current sequence and the other holding longest sequence. If current is longer than longest then copy current to the longest and continue. O(n) with two temporary lists space. Interviewer 2: Asked about ETL and it's advantages/disadvantages. I told him that I am a java/web developer and he still asked me to design a system and things to consider while transferring data from one DB to another. I asked if I should tell him things to consider in Java while doing this? He said no but "In general". He is an ETL developer. Not sure what I told satisfied him. Lunch Interviewer 3: Remote will have A-Z with 5 letters per line. Design a method which takes in a movie name and gives a string output which will have movement code (for e.g. for typing U you will move down three times and right a couple of times so the output should be (DDD!RR!) . I took longer than expected I guess to solve this one. But I got D, L and R movements in the given time crunch. My answer: Involves get int value of letter and get divisor and remainder by 5 and use them to determine moving direction and number of times. Interviewer 4: Design a restaurant. Inheritance and Composition basics.   1 Answer

talked about my resume for a while, mostly coding/algorithm questions. To tackle the problem, no matter you meet similar ones before or not, clarify the question first, make some examples, then elaborate your thoughts quickly (you can write a few pseudo codes to help understanding), and start to code on whiteboard. Focus on the structure while be careful with not making bugs. Key point is the analytical skills and responding speed, but coding skills are very important too.   Answer Question

The interview comes with two questions, all about basic programming: revert the bit sequence of a number(32 bits), like 0100 0110 0000 0001 -> 1000 0000 0110 0010. Just a reminder: the interviewer did require the most efficient way of programming.   Answer Question The second question was a bit confusing. Suppose you have a facebook API, which allows you to access all one's friends. Can you find if B is connect to A through friend's network? say A has friends (C,D,E) and C has friends(B,G). Now A is connected to B. I did the second one with a 7 layer for loop first, 'cause I was avoiding overloading the memory with too much data. However, the interviewer seems not to appreciate that. But I did answer the following up question wrong. He asked what is the big O for my code. A map search is N(nodes)+V(edge). I did not know that, I gave a answer of N, which is close but not correct.   Answer Question

I cannot discuss the questions as they were a part of the NDA I signed. I can tell there was a huge emphasis on the design in my interview. The interviewers(All of them) started by an open-ended question, to which I asked many many more clarifying questions to understand the scope of the problem and come up with possible assumptions under which I operated and produced pseudo-code and wrote code. I was interviewed by a mid level Software Engineer to begin with, then another mid-level Software Engineer, then by a Manager and finally by a Team Lead with 6 years of experience in GOOG. I was particularly interested in this interview as he seemed to come with experience working at a company that dealt with code security. A stark difference between my previous interviews(Please see below I have had more interviews at GOOG before) and this was that I was being asked to clarify the design on purpose and being prevented from writing code and given very little time to write code. This felt very strange to me. Either the interviewers were new to the process or were doing so on purpose, I couldn't tell. I got a real sense that they liked me during the interview with the messages they were trying to send me in terms of the conversation they were trying to engage me in....giving instant feedback and making me feel very comfortable during the process(Initially). But there was a time when they were just giving a requirement tracing it back and the problem space was very complex and AMBIGUOUS(Several moments during the interview were racking my brain quite a bit and there was significant pressure put....all a part of the GOOG interview).....I wade through the requirements and tried chopping off the constraints a bit and gave justification as appropriate. I wrote code in almost all the interviews except the ones that involved design and only design into the depth. All my interviews on the final interview were more than an hour and 15 mins, the lunch interview was short and just a casual overview of GOOG with the person who passed my resume, she isn't from the background I come from. I was again stumped why they were asking me to have lunch on campus with this person, I guessed that they probably wanted to see how I interacted with a plethora of people with different job descriptions on campus. This was very surprising part of the interview. I could tell that the interviewers were very keen on trying to sell GOOG to me, the workplace, their shipping cycles, their code review strategy, who they get new projects and how they share space with Mountain View office and collaborate and work. Finally I was escorted by a Team Lead and we seemed to continue the discussion as a continuation to the questions asked in the interview process. They were very engaging design discussions and I got a sense that this was a company I could look up to.   1 Answer

When you trow two dice, you have to close the boxes that sum up to the number on the dice; for example, if you get 6 and 1 on the two dice, you have to close boxes that add up to 7 (3 and 4, 2 and 5, 1 and 6) if they aren't already closed. Implement an algorithm that, given the status boxes and the value from the dice, returns all the possible combinations of boxes that can be closed to sum up to the number in the dice.   1 Answer

NDA so cannot disclose the questions. The questions I had were much more difficult than what my friends had and what people posted on websites like glassdoor, leetcode or careercup. They were about algorithms and data structures but far far away from obvious. One of them tested if I knew some arcane number theory stuff which I of course didn't. I would say the questions I had required much more than just the basic stuff that you could find in a typical algorithm book. I managed to solve them with the help of many hints from the interviewers, so I think I will not get the offer. Honestly if Google expects people to solve questions of that difficulty flawlessly and effortlessly, I can never meet that standard, not a chance.   Answer Question

Sparse matrices are usually stored by only storing the non-zero values. But, there is no single standard format for doing this. One such format is called Compressed Sparse Column (CSC). Example: The following matrix is stored in CSC format using three arrays, vals, rows, and cols.     /0 1 2 3 4 \     | a 0 0 0 0 | 0     | 0 c f 0 0 | 1     | 0 0 0 0 h | 2     | b d g 0 i | 3     | 0 0 0 0 0 | 4     | 0 e 0 0 0 | 5      \ /     vals = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i] ← double values     rows = [0, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 2, 3]     cols = [0, 2, 5, 7, 7] ← position in the vals array (think of it as pointers into “vals”) length of the cols array == the number of columns in the matrix Generate this representation of the matrix from a sequence of triples (row, col, val).

First interview - Warmup: The interviewer asked me a series of short questions. The running time (best, worst, average) of various sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heapsort. He also asked me about hash table and hash functions (average and worst case complexity of insertion, deletion and lookup). Central Question: Consider a setup where a program is continuously receiving floats as inputs (a stream of numbers). The task is to write a method that at any given time returns a moving average. That is the average of the last k numbers received. If the method is called before the program has received k numbers, simply return the average of however many numbers have been received thus far. The solution should obviously be optimal. Second interview - Warmup: Given an array of integers, write a method that places all the zeros at the end. Main question: Consider an interface which has the following two methods: interface Counter {   void inc();   int getLastMinuteCount(); } The method inc() is supposed to help keep track of the number of requests that clients make to a server (or something else along those lines). The getLastMinuteCount() is supposed to return the number of requests that the server has received in the last minute. The question is to implement a class that has these two methods included.   2 Answers

Optimize class string in stl. For example, a is a string, b is a string with value &amp;#034;hello&amp;#034;.

Then the programmer calls &amp;#034;b.uppercase&amp;#034;. b become &amp;#034;HELLO&amp;#034; while a is still &amp;#034;hello&amp;#034;.

Coding puzzle to test if you really know your favorite language and can use it to solve puzzles. They made me write code that compiles, and work through "compiler" errors until it was valid.   Answer Question Basic coding problem to test data structures and algorithms knowledge. Think recursion, heaps, binary search trees, that kind of stuff.   Answer Question System design problem, no coding involved. I had to design a large, complex system that I never could have done by myself. I just started designing what I could and the interviewer asked questions to guide and inform the design. By the end I think I seemed like a genius but I knew the interviewer was the one who knew the proper design, not me.   Answer Question Very vague coding task, I was given a function signature and spent the next 5 minutes teasing out potential solutions and discussing pro's and con's of each one. Eventually arrived at a multithreaded solution which they then wanted me to implement on the whiteboard. I did not need to know any specific threading API, because they let me use any libraries I wanted, even if they don't exist, just as long as they make sense. This question tested my knowledge of multithreading concepts thoroughly, so this is definitely something you should review!   Answer Question A very difficult-seeming coding problem. It's the type of problem that makes you crap yourself at first but if you keep a level head you can hopefully spot an elegant way to solve it. There is an obvious solution but it is very painful and inefficient to implement, and there is a more subtle solution using dynamic programming that is the most efficient and easiest to implement. They will know you're a rock star when you solve the problem elegantly using the proper CS concept.   Answer Question

Although I didn't formally sign an NDA I did agree to not talk about details on blogs or forums. That said I can only discuss in general terms. The questions were really not what I was expecting. There were two questions and neither of them required data structures or even an algorithm. Really just a standard coding question requiring some logic, analysis, and OO design but nothing fancy. Alas, for reasons beyond me the interviewer did not like how I answered the questions. Google does not provide any feedback on why you were rejected beyond a standard copy/paste response from the recruiter. On a side note- the interviewer didn't ask a single question about me or seem to care in the slightest. "Just another day, another interview" kind-of attitude. Which I guess is to be expected from them, but kinda depressing from the interviewee perspective. Afterwards I went through the interview minute-by-minute in my head and tried to guess what the interviewer was looking to see. Obviously it's a lot easier to come up with a great design when you are not under pressure. So no pearls of wisdom from me how I would do it differently since I felt I was very well prepared. I guess it's partially the luck of the draw, and the mood of the person doing the screening. When they have the full day of interview at least there needs to be a consensus from several interviewers. In the screening stage you get only one chance and one persons opinion to get you through the door.   Answer Question

All types of systems, UNIX, filesystems type question. One question in particular was "When you type www.google.com into a browser what happens?" I gave an answer of DNS resolving, first the client will see if it has an IP address cached for Google and if not contact one or more nameservers. I then went into detail about how DNS works and the various types of records and how the whole system has a hierarchy, zone transfers etc. At the end the interviewer asks "What really happens?" &lt;sigh&gt; Many times your interviewer will have very poor English skills and you will have to constantly ask them to repeat their questions - which does not look good for you. Other questions ask about how a basic filesystem works with inodes and hard links vs soft links. For my last phone interview I was told it would be focused on computer networking and the interviewer only asked questions about filesystems - nothing about networking.   1 Answer

Signed NDA and will respect the NDA. For a new grad, they focus primarily on CS fundamentals, so know your data structures and algorithms well. However, be able to think through your code design in terms of scalability, even if they don't ask you to parallelize the code. I think they test the same concepts as Microsoft does, but I'll summarize the difference between the two companies without revealing any coding questions. Microsoft will ask you questions like, "If apples cost $2 and bananas cost $3, how much does it cost me to buy 3 apples and 2 oranges?" Google will ask you a question along the lines of, "If apples cost $2 and bananas cost $3, and I have a $1 million dollars, how many unique fruit combinations can I buy?" Simply put, Google questions are more in depth and require more thought and finesse, even though the same concepts are used in solving them.   Answer Question
