As Eric Schmidt says, “Repetition doesn’t spoil the prayer.”

Hours per day: 4-5 hours per day

### :fire: Stage 1: Basic Knowledge (~5 days) :fire:
- [ ] Review concepts of each data structure
    - [ ] Implement and write tests for them.
    - [ ] Array, Stacks, Queues (Priority Queues), Linked List (Single vs Doubly), Hash Tables, Trees(Binary Trees, BST,Tries), Heap, Set, Hash Map (handling collisions, hashed linked map)
- [ ] String operations
    - Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIpliB-ton8
- [ ] Pros and cons of each data structure and when to use each of them.
- [ ] Understand basic algos
    - [ ] BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Sorting algos (Merge, Quicksort), Tree traversals. Code without hesitation.
- [ ] Pros and cons of each algo and when to use them.
- [ ] Be extremely proficient in time/space complexity analysis.
    - [ ] Know Big O for each data structure
- [ ] Recommended Resources to Read: DonBeave Interview Repo, The Technical Interview Cheat Sheet, Big O Cheat Sheet, http://discrete.gr/complexity/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book:Data_structures,http://opendatastructures.org/ods-java/, review Gayle's complexity chapter

### :fire: Stage 2: General Interview Questions (~7 days) :fire:
- Always better to write solution on paper. Second, if you can't handle the question, STOP & RESEARCH IT!
- Bits and bytes is definitely something I have to review
- [ ] Go through Cracking the Coding Interview Questions
- [ ] Leetcode
- [ ] Mission-Peace Repo

- Talk while thinking.
- Conduct an interview with Gainlo

### :fire: Stage 4: Company Specific Interviews (~4 days) :fire:
