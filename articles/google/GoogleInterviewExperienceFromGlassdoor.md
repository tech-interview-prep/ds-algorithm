Did the phone interview. I've applied at Google before and took another job because the process took so long. This time I applied to Google before I started looking anywhere else. It was a good decision as it took over 3 weeks to do the phone interview and another 2 weeks before they responded to my performance.

Write a function that given an array of numbers, return the highest occurrence of a number. Say 6 showed up the most (8 times) return 8. I over thought the question. This is in C and I'm guessing they just wanted a me to allocate a full array (256 for 8 bit) and +1 an entry whenever that number occurs (histo[number]++) while keeping the highest occurrence in a return variable if (histo[number] > highest) highest++;. I thought the solution was way too simple (like 6 lines tops) so I thought of a solution that would work for very large numbers for which a full array couldn't be allocated (64 bit = 2^64 array for instance). It wasn't as memory and computationally efficient as allocating a full array for lower bit number ranges (8, 16, 32) but it was a more robust and complete solution. Anyways, I guess he didn't see it that way. They turned me down. 8( So warning.. don't overthink a question on the phone interview. They're more likely to just want the 6 line quick answer on the phone interview. I think the phone interview is purely to weed out the complete idiots. If you overthink what they think is an easy problem then you look like a complete idiot. Onsite is be more challenging. I did the onsite a few years ago and the solutions and implementation required some thought.   Answer Question

The call was late for 10 minutes. The interviewer pasted the question on the shared Google doc and asked me if I understood the question. I said yes. Then he did not speak anything to me or give me any feedbacks during the interview. I felt like speaking to myself to explain my code and write code. After 40 minutes, he said thanks and goodbye, and hung up the phone 10 minutes earlier than expected. He sent feedbacks to the HR very quick. I got rejected in 20 hours.

Initial phone call from a recruiter who set up a phone screen with an engineer. Invited to an onsite a week later. I had 4 people interview me with one other person who took me to lunch. Got a reject from the recruiter 3 days after my onsite.

Phone interview: Given an NxN matrix how would you print all elements in a spiral way starting from the middle element. Phone interview answer: 4 for loops with conditions. Onsite: Interviewer 1: Q1: Find all pairs of numbers that equal to a given sum in a given int array. My Answer: Put all in a HashSet and iterate over elements to find sum - current number is present or not and add that pair to the result. O(n) runtime. Q2: Find the longest sequence of integers in a given int array. My Answer: Maintain two lists. One holding current sequence and the other holding longest sequence. If current is longer than longest then copy current to the longest and continue. O(n) with two temporary lists space. Interviewer 2: Asked about ETL and it's advantages/disadvantages. I told him that I am a java/web developer and he still asked me to design a system and things to consider while transferring data from one DB to another. I asked if I should tell him things to consider in Java while doing this? He said no but "In general". He is an ETL developer. Not sure what I told satisfied him. Lunch Interviewer 3: Remote will have A-Z with 5 letters per line. Design a method which takes in a movie name and gives a string output which will have movement code (for e.g. for typing U you will move down three times and right a couple of times so the output should be (DDD!RR!) . I took longer than expected I guess to solve this one. But I got D, L and R movements in the given time crunch. My answer: Involves get int value of letter and get divisor and remainder by 5 and use them to determine moving direction and number of times. Interviewer 4: Design a restaurant.

A few days later I was invited to in-person interviews. Deloitte flew me out on a Thursday night, and back Friday afternoon. The format was 1 case and 2 behavioral. To prep, I walked through Deloitte's case prep online, made sure I had solid experiences to share for about 5 different types of questions, and had a good "story" to tell about why Deloitte and why I wanted to switch. Case: Very straightforward. I was given the paper with the case on it. Focus was on an ERP implementation. I took my time to organize an initial response and explained how I setup/grouped the info (Strategy, opportunities, challenges). The interviewer walked me through the case, asking questions and followup questions. Key advice is to link everything back to the strategy, bring in ideas not in the case, and be able to come up with how "your" services will add value (+profit or -cost) to the company. Behavioral: 2 separate interviews. Very similar. Be able to have solid examples that show a variety of experiences. Be personable, that is what consulting is about. Be able to show results and value from your past experiences. Afterwards I followed up with emails. Heard back the following Tuesday via a phone call. Took about 2 weeks to work out the offer before I accepted. Everyone I met was incredibly friendly and professional. Very impressed overall.

The interview process began with a recruiter reaching out to me by email in early September. I had not applied to Google in the past, nor submitted an application, so I assume that they found me through LinkedIn. The recruiter set up a brief phone call to discuss my interests and to explain Google's interview process for SWE interns. I had 2 45-minute technical interviews over the phone with 2 separate software engineers. Both gave me a single question to solve. My recruiter called me the next day to inform me that I did well in my interviews and will be moving on to the Hiring Committee. After one week, my recruiter called to inform me that the Hiring Committee would require that I take a third interview, in order to have more data points. This usually means that the feedback from the two interviewers did not match. My third interview went very well, and, after two weeks of waiting, my recruiter informed me that I had passed Hiring Committee and would be entering Host Matching. Two days later, I was scheduled to have a call with my new recruiter to discuss Host Matching. This new recruiter informed that the Hiring Committee would be extended to me an Open Offer. This means that I have the option to accept an offer before I am matched with a host, guaranteeing a job with Google regardless of outcome of Host Matching. The reason this is significant is that there is a possibility of not being matched with a Host, and thus not receiving an offer. Open Offers are not common and are usually given to candidates who do exceptionally well on their interviews.

I applied online on October, 2016 but did not hear back until December. While waiting, I personally contacted one of the employee who I knew from my university and right after I was referred by that person, the recruiter began contacting me for documentation and scheduling the interviews. I went through three separate phone interviews Jan~Feb, 2016. The interviews were sequential--scheduled one after another. All interviews were about coding questions. No question on my resume or background at all. All was 1:1 and the interviewees were very interactive and trying to help.

There were one or two coding questions per an interview and most of the questions were similar in its pattern: Given specific set of data (e.g. 2D matrix with random values or with some patterns), what is the best way to do some specific operations (e.g. searching or sorting) on that dataset?

A Phone screening, a phone coding interview, and a onsite interview. In the interview, there were 3 problem solving sessions, a lunch session and 1 designing session (but mainly discussed about what I've done during PhD.). I thought the interview went pretty well, but couldn't get the offer. The recruiter gave me a feedback that my problem solving skill was good enough but the interviewers didn't like how I write the code. The facts I can say is that 1) I finished writing all solutions I suggested and 2) at least the interviewers agreed the code works. Probably the coding style was not that impressive to them.

Week 1 Recruiter emails to set up phone screen Week 2 Recruiter phone screen: informal phone call with recruiter to discuss your current projects and skills Week 4 Coding sample: they give you link to 2 coding problems you have to solve in 60 mins Week 9 One phone interview with google docs: this is where most of the filtering of candidates happen. I delayed this for 4 weeks to review. Interviewer was helpful and was not intimidating. Make sure you walk through your thinking and not go straight to coding. 2 problems, was not able to finish the 2nd one but I told him my approach. Make sure to engage the interviewer throughout the 45 minutes. They will give you a broad problem, so ask questions! Week 12 Onsite interviews: the most fun interview experience I've ever had! They're campus is awesome. They book you to this very nice hotel with shuttle to the campus. They pay for hotel and flight, reimbursements for food and ground travel expenses. 2 interviews in the morning, lunch with another engineer (not an interview), 2 interviews in the afternoon. First 2 interviewers were really friendly. 3rd interviewer was kind of intimidating. He was on his laptop don't know if he's taking notes or doing his own thing. I was still able to engage him a little bit and was still able to come up with a solution. 4th interview was where I screwed up. The interviewer was from an Asian background and I could not understand most of the words she was saying. I wasn't prepared for the question. It was with a lot of analysis and math. All interviewers take pictures of your code for every progress and fixing of bugs you make. Approach to all interviews: ask questions, talk through your approach, start coding at the same time talking to what you're writing, do testing Week 14 Recruiter called me they cannot give me an offer. I was kind of expecting this because I knew I have to nail all 4 interviews. They cannot disclose any information regarding the decision I may not have received an offer, but going on-site was such an amazing and memorable experience!

I was contacted after submitting my resume through their website. The recruiter was friendly and helpful, making sure I knew what to expect throughout the process. After a technical phone interview, involving answering a coding problem, I was asked to come in for an all day set of interviews consisting of 4 whiteboard coding interviews and a design interview. Around a week later I was told that the interview committee had recommended hiring me and it was two weeks of back and forth with the recruiter before I received an offer. The whole process from first being contacted to receiving an offer was around two months. This was expedited by the fact I received a competing offer from another company after taking the phone interview.

The coding questions seemed intended to determine how I gathered necessary information, my problem solving process, if I can notice errors in my code given some prompting (such as asking how a certain input would be handled), determining complexity of the solution, and so on. They weren't concerned with precise code so much as if I could communicate what I was doing.   Answer Question

The interview started off great! The interviewer (who I will not name) started out by asking me what I'd been working on recently. I told him about one of my side projects (a Node.js based web app) that I found both interesting and worthy of note. He started asking me questions about my project, which was a useful exercise. Useful except for he never offered any sort of constructive criticism, and never gave any indication of whether my answers were good, or even acceptable. He also cut my train of thought off continuously, which was a theme of the entire interview. This is when I started feeling like the interview would probably not go so well. Once we moved past him asking questions about my side project, and him explaining several times he loves "free styling" the beginning portion of the interview, he moved onto asking me questions he had prepared. I don't remember the exact wording of his question, but it was essentially: "create a function that grabs an HTML element, and, within a specific time period, change its color." As it might be obvious, I had a few questions right from the get go. First of all, what is this specific time period? What do you mean "change its color"? What color? I asked these, and more, questions, but it took some time to get a solid answer out of the interviewer. This was another theme throughout the interview. While attempting to solve the problem, I was trying my best to speak out my thought process (as per everything that gives advice for doing interviews), and noticed something. The interviewer seemed to always audibly set his phone down and turn it on speaker mode. I gave him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that he was typing down his interview notes. That being said, it was extremely distracting, and gave the impression that he wasn't paying attention to what I was saying. I mentioned before that he cut my train of thought off continuously, and this still holds true. Most often when I was asking questions, I would have a follow up question because he was being (perhaps purposefully?) vague. Whenever I asked the follow up question, I would almost immediately be cut off while he tried to describe something unrelated to my question, but related to the problem I was solving. Initially you might think that whatever he cut me off to say was important, but I can assure you, none of it was ever helpful. After about 15 minutes into the coding problem, the interviewer cut me off in the middle of me explaining my thought process to tell me that I now had access to two new helper functions. I know he did that because I was struggling a bit with one part of the problem, but he also kept telling me I didn't need to modify my original code in order to make use of these new functions... which I thought was strange. He also kept pointing out portions of my code that might not run correctly, and then when I would respond by trying to solve those problems, he would cut me off to say "we don't need to worry about these" and would tell me to move on. And without any warning after around 25 minutes into the problem, he said "okay, we're done. Do you have any questions for me?" I asked him was "do you like where you work?" he responded with a very convoluted answer that was 90% him explaining he started his own company, and then interviewed with Google once (he really emphasised the "once") and got the job there. He didn't even give me an answer the first time I asked. It felt very much like he was tipping his nose up at me, and the word "tool" came to mind several times. After I finally got that answer out of him, he said "alright, times up, nice talking to you, have a good one" and hung up all of a sudden. I didn't even have time to say "bye" before he hung up. Overall, the coding problem portion felt extremely rushed (a problem that could have been easily remedied by not "free styling" the beginning of the interview), and was very confusing and frustrating due to the vagueness of the interviewer's answers to my questions, and constant unrelated comments on the interviewer's end. And the entire interview felt extremely unprofessional, and I couldn't help but think the interviewer had something else to do, or didn't want to interview in the first place. I wouldn't want to work with this person, let alone have him interview potential employees. He seemed self absorbed, wasn't good with his communication skills, and looked down on me. I'm okay with not being offered a job knowing that Google employs people like him.

The interview has 3 steps. Step 1: Online coding This section of the interview is exactly how it sounds. You get a link to a website and have an hour to complete 2 questions. Step 2: Phone screening This section is you setting up an appointment with an interviewer and code on a google docs document. You'll be talking with the interviewer on the phone while coding on the document, no IDE available. Step 3: On site interviews This section is the most rigorous. You fly to Google's campus and have 4 45 minute interviews back to back. with a 1 hour lunch break.

It is on-campus interview. The question that I was asked is the Number of Island II in the leetcode. The second question is that we are given a 2-D boolean array.

However, the second was about testing. It wasn't hard, but I misunderstood the question and also I am not too familiar with writing tests, so I failed. Two weeks later recruiter informed me that they want to have another phone screen. Fortunately, it was algorithmic again and few hours after they pushed me to the host matching.

I was contacted by Google recruiter. The entire process was taking about 2.5 weeks. I had one technical phone interview and thereafter I was asked to come for the on-site interview at Google HQ a week later. The recruiter was nice and helpful. I'd suggest eating a breakfast or something light prior starting the onsite interview since there was no breakfast or snack provided while I was waiting in the check-in area for the recruiter to come get me. Once I was in the room, the interview started right away. The onsite interview I had was consisting of 5 interviews and one lunch.The onsite interview format was typical (introduction, talked about what I've done, write codes on whiteboard (algorithm, optimization), write test cases, determining a running time of your own code) like any other big tech companies. The interview questions were difficult and pushing a lot of limit. Most interview sessions were great and most interviewers were very helpful and tried to steer and guide me in the right direction whenever I was stuck. However, there was one interview session I'd consider as the worst interview I've had experienced. It was surprising to me how Google still had a very very bad and arrogant interviewer. This particular interviewer made the entire session extremely stressful. I wasn't sure if this interviewer was trying to show off a person who was shadowing the interview session. The entire session was very unhelpful, condescending and interrogative. I've never received any helpful guide whenever I asked for clarification and tried to explain my approach. This reminded me of an immature teenager who giggled at a person who was doing things wrong. I guess it was one of those days. The person whom I had lunch (interview) with didn't seem to know (or care) anything about Google internally. When I asked about his day-to-day was like, he never had a clear respond and did not had any sense of excitement working at Google except food. I learned more things about Google projects from the recruiter than this person. I was quite disappointed.

I couldn't tell much due to NDA, but here the hints: recursion, tree, DFS/BFS and graph are definitely MUST know. Something along the line with finding common ancestor, longest increasing sequence, knowing tradeoffs of different types of sorting.   Answer Question

The interview process was good. The recruiter was very friendly and helped me throughout the process. The first step was about 20 mins talk with recruiter, which was not technical. Then, I got a link for a coding challenge. The challenge was easy. After I completed the challenge, they setup a phone interview. Unfortunately, the phone interview did not go well and they informed me after 2 days that they will not move forward with the application. Overall, it was a good experience.

NDA: I can't mention the questions because of NDA. But the coding challenge questions were basic string and array manipulation questions.

Did a phone technical interview, then went through to an onsite interview (standard five 1:1 interviews where you code on a whiteboard), got a brief tour of their office while I was there. Everyone was very nice, very cordial, very willing to answer questions. Had four brief phone calls with different teams who were interested. These were mainly just them telling me what their team was doing, and if I had any specific questions to them. Got a call a couple days later saying I was matched. The interviews were hard, but definitely not as difficult as I thought they would be. Communicate with your interviewer, they're very open and willing to help as much as they can. Review your algorithms and do practice questions as much as you can. They'll also tailor some questions to your specialty if you've specified one (for example, I mainly had front-end experience so two of my five interviews were more front end focused).

The Google interviewing process is super long and slow. The steps for me were recruiter phone screen, coding challenge, technical phone interview, and then onsite (4 rounds of 45 min interviews). In between each step was roughly 2-3 weeks, so the entire process took roughly 2 months. The phone screens and coding challenge were really easy, just typical DFS or integer array/string manipulation questions. Just study up on Hackerrank/Leetcode and you'll be okay. My onsite was a nightmare and honestly a terrible experience. The questions themselves were not bad, and I solved most of them in time and made optimizations for them. But the process itself was so bad: I was given the incorrect building and no schedule in the morning, so I had no idea where to go. I had 4 technical interviewers and 1 lunch interviewer: the first two technical interviewers were really nice and engaged, but the 3rd and 4th honestly made me not want to work at Google. The 3rd was very disengaged and was checking his phone/writing emails when I was whiteboarding. The 4th also didn't seem to pay attention to what I was doing and didn't really answer my questions at the end; just not very sociable. My lunch interviewer was a nice lady but she had no idea what was going on, and since I wasn't given a schedule of events, she thought our lunch lasted for longer than it did and made me 20 minutes late to my last interview. That added to the terrible time I had getting to the actual Google campus (did you know that Google only reimburses you $60 if you are a local candidate? Good luck getting there if you don't have a car.) made me lose a ton of interest in actually working there.

The interview process consisted of 3 steps: 1. Online coding challenge. 2. Phone Screen 3. On-site Interview I felt like each stage was fair but difficult. For the online challenge, I had to answer 2 questions within 60 minutes - was able to finish one, and finished pseudo-coding the second one. I would prioritize writing clean and correct code on this part. Even if you don't get the answer, document things out very clearly. The phone screen asked some standard C++ memory management questions in addition to a string/array manipulation question. Onsite consisted of 2 interviews in the morning, lunch with an engineer, and 2 more interviews in the afternoon. I felt like 3/4 interviews went really well, and I struggled through one of them. Questions consisted of BFS/DFS, Graph Traversal/Construction, Linked List, String Array Manip, and Key-Value Mapping. I felt like all of the questions were pretty standard, but definitely required thinking and mapping out your thought process. Additional Advice: Focus on clean and correct code and talking through each of your steps. I know this is what everyone says, but even when you're stuck and you continue communicating, your interviewer will likely give you prompts and hints to keep you moving. The Google interview process is tough, but if you spend 2-3 months prepping with Cracking the Code Interview beforehand, you should have a competitive chance of getting an offer. Only con was the amount of time it took to hear back from each stage.

A College Recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn. The process was then as follows: *15 minute chat * Online coding sample. 2 problems, 1 hour. * One phone screening. Work through a fairly straightforward coding problem. Depending on how this goes, you might get another phone screen. * Onsite. 4 interviews, all coding problems. You have a choice between using a whiteboard or a Chromebook (definitely recommend the latter). Lunch onsite, they take care of flights, hotel, food, transport, etc. * Your application is then packaged up for the hiring committee to make a decision.

Recruiter contacted me for a 1 year contract position. The 1st phone interview conducted 2 weeks later, the interview asked me to write code to detect if there is a cycle in singly linked list cycle, then ask time complexity, the 2nd question he asked is to write a circular buffer. I think I did not very well since there was no response in next 3 weeks. One day recruiter told me Google wanted 2nd phone interview, so we set up the 2nd phone interview 1 week later, this time I passed as I was asked to go onsite 1 week later. The onsite was conducted 2 week later, 5 interviewers each one has 1 hour session. I believe I did very good but again I did not get any response in next 3 weeks so I asked recruiter. He told me I was the only candidate for this position but Google was still doing the interviews with more candidates. Another 2 weeks passed, recruiter told me they moved to other candidate. The total process took about 3 months. Most of the interviewers were friendly except the team lead, he was very rude for some reason. The overall interview process is frustrating.

A recruiter contacts your first and sets up an initial technical phone screen. Depending on how well that phone screen went, the recruiter will contact you again and either let you know you're moving to the on-site interview or another phone screen. I believe the maximum screens they do is 2. They might ask you if you want a practice phone screen with a reviewer in between. It's actually a really pleasant process whether you do well or not. The onsites I've heard of are pretty intense - with about 5-6 hours of constant interviewing with several people.

They generally ask algorithms questions and make you write it up in a google doc with the interviewer. My phone screens were nothing out of the ordinary.   Answer Question

I was reached out to by a recruiter. I talked to him on the phone, and he asked a couple of technical questions, and then it went to a technical phone interview. There I wrote a program in python on a google doc, and was asked to come visit. I couldn't make it at the time and I called off the on-site interview. Fast forward a year and a half, and I was contacted again by a recruiter. I was more ready to see what Google had to offer, and asked to come out to visit their office in Boulder. I was super excited! What an opportunity! So, after a few weeks I went out there at my scheduled time. There are five mini-interviews and a lunch. Each mini-interview is a programming challenge, each one was like a homework assignment from a year 1 or 2 comp-sci class. Of course, the interviewer knows the questions and how to ask break the answer I came up with. But, overall it was kind of fun. Where it really broke down for me though was that there was no real making a connection with the interviewer. I am gainfully employed and I was really there to see if I could work with these guys, if it was worth the risk of starting a new job for the benefit of getting to work for a world-class software company. And the answer turned out to be no. I couldn't get a handle on the emotions of any of my interviewers at all. Everything they said sounded like it came from a script. Which I guess would be okay, but the worst part was the lunch. They paired me up with a random dude from the office, and I just could not connect. I asked about what he did, and got a single sentence about financial transactions. I asked about a generally geeky topic, and was told that "I'm sure that we should be using this time to talk about Google, and not <geeky topic>." Shocked at this, I said that I really wanted to know about who I was going to be working with, and asked what he was passionate about. I swear that he recited his college admission essay, and threw out a bunch of techno-babble that I'm sure was to impress me. Then I was shuttled back to the little conference room. I don't think I could even tell you what I felt right then, but I didn't feel very welcome or excited anymore. What I think this process taught me, is that I was supposed to be very impressed about Google as a brand. I wanted so bad to fit in, but I realized that it just wasn't for me. As I really looked hard at where I actually was, I saw that behind the velociraptor statue was a cubicle wall. It was just an office, like any other. The last 3 interviews in the afternoon, I may have self-sabotaged. I just didn't care anymore. I asked the interviewers what projects they worked on, and I got the same lack of passion I got from my lunch-mate. On the last interview I wasn't even writing code anymore, just some set notation and lambda functions to map over them. It was totally self serving, and I'm not convinced that the interviewer cared to follow along. I got a phone call about a week latter, to let me know that I had been passed up. Which was really nice to get. If I can say one thing about this process, it was very pleasant. I was so relived to hear that I had not been given an offer. If I had been, it would have been devastating to have to turn it down. A positive note, is that I did see people eating together during lunch, no one was alone. Which tells me that people do get along there. I'm sure it's not as bad as I perceived it to be.

I was contacted by a Technical Recruiter to schedule a phone interview. After I passed the phone interview, I was then forwarded to a different Technical Recruiter to handle my on campus interview. I traveled to Google HQ in Mountain View, CA and had a series of interviews with 1 lunch interview. There was a Heavy Importance on Data Structure knowledge and Algorithms One slight criticism is that since google's interview process is somewhat a black box even to your other interviewers. I was asked the same domain of question 3 times in a row. When I told the 2nd and 3rd interviewers that this had occurred they seemed flustered and put on the spot to come up with another question. I feel like this should not be the case. Though it is understandable since we are all human. Just something to keep in mind.

For rest, I spoke for most of the time and he didn't seem to have any questions and answered any clarifications I had. It was good. There were 2 questions during phone screen, one was like a warm up and second a bit more challenging. I was glad I was able to attempt and complete both. Not sure if second solution was completely correct. But spoke out my approach and explained after every problem I solved. I felt I did fairly well. But didn't pass through.

I was contacted via email by a recruiter after submitting my solutions for the 3rd level of Google Foobar, we set up a call. The recruiter was very friendly and the phone screening lasted about 20 to 30 mins. I was asked about my previous experience and if I would be willing to move, also which role was I more comfortable with front or back. After this the recruiter asked for my resume via email to go ahead and schedule the first technical interview. The technical interview is done through Google docs It was not hard at all, the problem was a very simple one, the only problem I found was that the interviewer had a very thick Indian accent and I spent most of the interview trying to figure out what the interviewer was trying to say. I started solving the problem and when i got stuck the interviewer was trying to help me but because of the accent I couldn't understand and got distracted and couldn't finish the code :( My advise, if you are note familiar with Indian accent, practice to sharpen your ear.

I was contacted by a recruiter last year and had a series of initial conversations about my areas of interest and what opportunities were available at Google. In my particular case, Google waived the phone screen, and I was able to come directly onsite. I don't know if this is a common occurrence or not. A good chunk of my professional network is employed at Google - so I suspect that having some number of internal referrals may have helped. This is complete conjecture on my part though. I came to one of the campuses in Mountain View in July 2016 for my onsite interview. Initially, I had 5 interviews onsite. 4 of the interviews were coding sessions, and 1 interview was a system design question. The coding questions were challenging (one of them in particular I found to be quite difficult). The interviewers were good about making the sessions interactive and asking questions to help guide my thinking. While I cannot share specific questions - reviewing CS fundamentals (algorithms and data structures) will be helpful. The questions were similar to other ones I had been asked by other similar companies I was interviewing with or that I had come across online while studying. They're not quite the same but are similar in terms of topics covered and difficulty. In all of the interviews, interviewers asked how I could optimize my solution to scale for extreme cases. They didn't necessarily want to see me code a solution that could scale to large traffic volume or lots of data, but they wanted to see if I had an idea on what I could change or improve to optimize what I had written. Make sure you're comfortable evaluating the time and space complexity of your code. The interviewers were very cordial and were happy to answer any questions I had about what it was like to work at Google. About a week and a half after my onsite interview, the recruiter had indicated that I had done well enough to move forward in the process. The next step was to match to a particular team. I spent about 2 weeks speaking with various hiring managers and technical leads before finding a team where we mutually felt that I would be a good fit for the team. After I matched, my packet was then reviewed by an executive (an SVP of engineering). In my particular case, the SVP requested that I come in for one more additional system design interview. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence or not. Based on my research online and speaking with some of my friends who work at Google, this usually isn't typical. I came back to Mountain View one more time for a one hour system design interview. After the interview, I was informed by the recruiter a few days later that based on my performance in the final interview that the SVP had approved my offer, and I accepted shortly afterwards. In terms of time frame, the process was roughly 6 weeks from when I had my initial onsite interview to when I was extended an offer. In comparison to some of the other large companies I was interviewing with at the time, this was better than average in terms of latency (many of the other companies took longer to turn around a decision). Overall, the process was pleasant. The recruiters who I worked with were extremely professional and very timely in their communication. They kept me in the loop constantly and responded to questions quickly. The engineers I spoke with onsite were all very nice and professional.

Questions types: Strings, graph search(BFS/DFS), recursion on Binary tree, binary search, divide & conquer. Make sure prepare for all of those types questions and need to achieve optimal solutions. Practice whiteboard coding(important!) before onsite. I suggest to do a few mock interviews ahead.

I applied online and was contacted within a few days. Typical interview process: first a short phone call with a recruiter, then a 1 hour long technical phone interview with an engineer, followed by a 6 hour onsite interview. The questions were not as difficult as I expected, though I may have been lucky and received a sequence of easier questions. The interview is also a test of endurance; by the end, I could barely think straight. If you want to prepare properly, I would do one or two practice sessions where you do 5 interview practice questions in a row. If you have a strong understanding of graph algorithms and fundamental data structures, I imagine you'll pull through. Also make sure you can determine the Big O complexity of whatever code you write, as the engineers will ask for your analysis after you finish each question. I think I answered 4 out of 5 questions correctly at the onsite interview, so I did not receive a job offer.

Emailed recruiter (June 19) I had when I applied last year, asking to apply again. On June 30th I was contacted to schedule a phone screen for July 7th. Then we scheduled a phone interview for July 12th. Phone interview began with solving a fairly straightforward technical problem. Then after coding it on google docs, we talked about how to solve the problem so that it is scalable. This went really well, so I was called the next day and invited to come on-site. On-site (July 27th) consisted of 5 interviews: Interview 1: -Straightforward tree problem, solved without much of a hitch. -Extend same problem to work for a forest of DAGs. Had to rewrite the entire code but this was actually easier. -Discussed a third, more difficult problem. It was very similar to a problem I had already seen before, which I told him, but we continued, and I gave him the solution after a bit of remembering. Interview 2: -Straightforward array-of-objects question, went smoothly. Did a little bit of optimization that made it use constant memory in some instances. -Float array problem which I told him I had seen before. He said let's move on but I told him I had an answer which I thought was better than the more obvious solution. I told him it, and he said he'd never seen that solution before and agreed it was better for many instances. -Complex int array question. Was stumped for a while on this, needed some help. Eventually got a solution in O(n^2), then the day after when I was thinking about it I figured out a O(nlogn) solution, so mine was suboptimal. Interview 3: -Int array question, told him I'd seen it before, but he said that was ok. Solved without issue -Tree question, solved with a little bit of help. A little messy and suboptimal, I came up with a much cleaner solution after the interview. -System design-y question. I had about 3 minutes left. Told him my thoughts, he said it was in "the right direction", but I dunno. Interview 4: -Int array question, blurted out a solution immediately (which I kind of regretted), but he said, ok then code it, which I did without a problem. After coding it, he asked how to make it faster. I thought about it, and got the optimal solution without help but he didn't want me to code it. -String array question, again gave brute-force solution, then coded it. However, I had a LOT of trouble getting better than brute-force. Maybe 5-10 minutes of not getting anywhere (At least it felt like it). Interview 5: -Talked very briefly about a project I did last Summer. Seemed like she wanted to get past it ASAP. -She asked two questions, both of which I had seen before, which I told her. I rattled off the solution for both and she didn't ask me to code them. First question was a string/palindrome question. Second was a question about a series of lightbulbs. -Third question was an extension of the first, which I solved, but needed a little guidance at the end. She seemed happy with my use of StringBuilder. 3 business days after the interview (Wednesday), I was told by my recruiter that she got the feedback from 3 of the 5 interviewers and they were "very positive". That Friday I was told the hiring committee had recommended me for hire. The following Friday (what a nerve-wracking week) I was given an official offer. (August 12) Advice: BUY "CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW". I went through the entire book, cover to cover (skipping programming-language specific chapters and the databases chapter, as well as the "hard" chapter) and wrote solutions down on paper. About a month before my interview, I started writing solutions down on a whiteboard, and began talking about the problems out loud while doing them. I HIGHLY recommend this. About 2 weeks before the interview, I studied the problems on careercup.com, which I thought was very influential to my success. If you do this, it is ESSENTIAL that you tell the person interviewing you when you are given a problem you've seen before. If you don't, they may see how quickly you solve it, and this could hurt your interview rather than help it. Also, telling them gets you honesty points, which can help. Four of the questions I was asked I had seen before exactly. Finally, don't give up! Two years ago, I tried to get an internship. The phone interviews went terribly. The next year, I got on-site, but the interviews only went ok, and got rejected. This year, I prepared for months, and it really does pay off. Even if your previous interviews were not so good.

I had my on-site interview at the Mountain View complex on July 11th, received news of my approval by the hiring committee 2-3 weeks after that, and received my offer letter on August 19th. Each interview is with a different engineer, each of whom describes a problem to solve on the whiteboard within 45 minutes. The key is to talk and listen carefully to your interviewer. They'll hint at mistakes you've made and guide you towards the best solution. Most importantly, remain calm. Don't wear yourself down trying to study beforehand, just practice a few hard problems a week, or one a day leading up to the interview, on paper, and no more than one the morning of the interview. Get a good night's sleep, some herbal tea, a full breakfast, and take the time while you wait for people, to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

One phone interview, about 45 minutes. My recruiting contact sent me preparatory materials and explained the process beforehand. Interviewer opened by asking about a project on my resume; rest of the time was on a couple technical problems. I wrote code in a shared Google Doc while talking on the phone. Questions required writing algorithms involving bit manipulation. Google flew me to Mountain View for on-site interviews after I passed the phone screen. Four one-on-one on-site interviews, each ~45 minutes. Coding was done on a whiteboard. Three interviews were primarily on algorithms/data structures; the other involved OOP. Each interviewer had his/her own style, but overall atmosphere was informal and collaborative. Interviews were back-to-back. After the first two, a different employee accompanied me for lunch and to answer my questions.

I was referred by an employee and was contacted by a recruiter shortly. I did not have to go through phone screens and was brought onsite straightaway. There were 5 rounds in total, all of them focused on coding and algorithm design. One interviewer asked me to solve a problem in a distributed setting. But the rest of the problems completely dealt with standard data structures and algorithms. Very pleasant experience.

I was contacted by a recruiter that saw my resume from a previous application and liked it. He requested an updated resume and some transcripts and then scheduled a phone meeting to talk to me. After we spoke, we set up an online coding test (language of my choice) for me to take to see if I was even worth their time. It was 2 questions in 60 minutes. It was pretty challenging, giving the time constraint. I finished the first one, but did not have time to fully debug the second. I thought I blew it, but received a call that they wished to move forward with me. There was also a brief personality quiz I had to take. It was pretty standard HR stuff. After this, there were two phone interviews. Each one was with a Google engineer. A google doc was opened and I had to write code for 45 minutes on the spot. Talk through your responses with them. They want to see that you know how to think. After this, I was flown out to California for the onsite interviews. There were 4 interviews and a lunch with an engineer. They ask you questions and you code on a whiteboard. The interviewers don't seem very interested in you as a person and there is not a lot of personality here. They are simply grilling you on coding ability. My first three interviews went great. I solved the problems and had time to optimize them. On the last interview, my interviewer was 8 minutes late. He did not speak great English, and seemed eager to be finished with me. He let me misunderstand the problem and go in the wrong direction for 20 minutes before saying something. I had to start over and manged to just get the main parts of my code down (still uncompilable) before time ran out. I am quite sure this interview is what ruined my chances. I received a call about a week later that they did not want to move forward with me as a software engineer, but as I was still a good candidate, they wanted to consider me for their residency program. The program is similar to a post-graduate internship, where they give you 3 months of classroom learning and 9 months of project work, then evaluate you again after to see if they want to hire you. As I already had some great offers from other companies, I declined. Overall the experience was positive. I just wish it hadn't taken so long and my last interviewer had been better.

Phone screen followed by an on-site interview. This was my second time applying. The on-sites are 5-6 problems, each 45 minutes long, with an hour for lunch. The problems are far from trivial, though they usually throw a gimme problem in there. I've been disappointed with them not because they decided to withhold an offer, but because they won't give any feedback on your performance. As a relatively recent grad, that doesn't help me to focus on my areas for improvement. I recognize that this is somewhat the norm in the job hunting process, but Google was even more restrictive than other companies with what they would share. This is also after they called me every 6 months from my first interview encouraging me to apply again. I'm not sure that I would any more, I worry that their feedback culture around interviews is indicative of the feedback culture within the company.

I was reached within one week after I applied online. Everything moved quite smoothly. There were two technical rounds back to back. However I was sick for one week before the interview so the technical rounds got quite delayed. We coded via Google Doc. One week after the interviews the recruiter told me that I was not selected, which was quite reasonable because I sort of screwed up one round with more math. I also got a survey asking for my feedback on experience later. Google provided a prep doc before the interview and advice for future after my rejection.

Can't say due to NDA. But you should be able to know some discrete math, combinatorics, and elementary number theory stuff, which was why I screwed the first round up; You should also be able to do more advanced topics like backtracking and dynamic programming.

I really enjoyed all of my interactions with the recruiters. The phone screen and phone interview were enjoyable and challenging. During the onsite interview itself, the tone felt very serious and intense. I tried to enjoy myself working through the problems, but it was quite the marathon. There wasn't much time during the interview itself to ask many questions, it felt like an intense performance or exam. The interview mostly focused on algorithm and coding problems. There were also some questions about time and space complexity. We covered a lot of different topics - but I felt well prepared, because the recruiter gave me a really good idea of what to look into before getting to the onsite interview. After the interview, I met my potential team - they seemed really laid back and friendly, and I got a generally good sense of the culture at the company. It seems like a fantastic place to work, but I ultimately chose a smaller company for the time being.

I was contacted by a recruiter. We decided that Boulder in the Google Docs group would be the best fit for my interests and background. The phone interview was fine, although I thought the interviewer was a little bit snarky when I responded to his question on how to improve Docs. I had an onsite interview with 5 different sets of people. A couple of the people were very nice, but I found the others to be rather socially inept. It is a tech company, so I expect this to some extent, but their interview process needs to take this into consideration. Only one person asked a question even remotely related to my work (about decision making and rationality I believe), and he had his set of opinions about it so didn't seem to like what I said. The coding interviews were all very similar- pretty contrived problems designed to test only one's coding knowledge. I went into the interviews believing that they appreciated creative solutions, but realized that if your solution is not one of the handful that they are familiar with, then they are unable to recognize the solution as viable. (Perhaps this is also partly my own fault if I didn't clearly express my idea), but a couple of them seemed very doubtful of anything I came up with. Also, communication problems were an issue. One interviewer asked me to generate a random number. I asked "from scratch"? and he said yes. I thought about that one for a while and said I was stumped, not knowing the mathematics behind creating a pseudo random number. When I said that he was annoyed and went on to explain how to call rand(). At this point he was not interested in hearing what I had to say as an explanation or in my defense. The last interviewer shooed me out the door without asking if I needed to use the restroom, or if I had any questions. I note that I am female and the interviewers were all male. Some of the behavior may have been due to bias, or perhaps those people were simply biased against anyone new! There were very few women at that office though, 7 out of 200 engineers or something like that. Hopefully things have improved since then, but at that point I decided that Google was not a good fit and that I likely would not interview with them again.

I interviewed in NYC. No phone screen because of my previous experience. Besides the convenience of the location, I did not enjoy the hotel I was put in. Ask for The Maritime if you get the chance. Interview day was very good overall. The system design question was about a field that did not match my background at all at I was a bit disappointed about that. Between review committees, team selection, and other stuff it took over a month to discuss the offer details. When it came to that phone call my recruiter refused to give me any details if I didn’t tell him my other offers first. I didn’t. This introduced other delays and put me in a very weird position with other companies that I was still interviewing with. I believe that Google prepared a 'low ball' but then refused to pitch it once I told them that some other players were in the game. The offer finally arrived while I was flying to California for another interview (I can’t just sit and wait after all). It sounded in the middle of the range that I asked for but when I received it in writings I realized that it was just below the lower range that we discussed. Let’s blame that on miscommunication or great presentation skills on their side. Google refused to negotiate those numbers at all in two different occasions and went in ‘radio silence’. By the time they got back to me checking if I wanted to continue the conversation I had already accepted another offer, quit my job, and took a flight to the other side of the world to enjoy my time off. I cannot believe that this did not work out. Google was my #1 pick at the time. No regrets.

Had a tech screen with live coding in a Google doc. Received feedback about a week later saying they were going to pass on me and encouraged me to reapply in one year.

onsite interview, very good experience. unfortunately, didn't make it. I guess I have to prepare better and practice more.

The hiring process took over a month. The onsite interviews were very well organised, all interviewers seemed friendly, no problems there. After around a week my recruiter informed me that all feedback was submitted and that it will be presented to a hiring committee. I was very surprised to hear that the committee did not make any decision on my case and asked for external and internal references. This already seemed a bit unusual for a hiring process for a new grad software engineer... Still, I gathered the references which were very positive and my recruiter submitted them again to a hiring committee. This time my recruiter said the decision was "yes, if we can get a supportive team at Google", so we started looking for a potential team match. I went through two additional phone interviews with managers from two different offices. One of the managers said he would be happy to have me on his team and wrote a strong letter of support for the hiring committee to review. I was really surprised when my recruiter informed me after that that their decision was still negative. When I expressed my surprise, she finally said that my case was borderline from the beginning and there was not much chance of me getting through... I am wondering why they haven't told me that sooner and kept asking for more information which took a lot of time and effort to gather. The whole process rolled over for a few weeks and I had to keep other companies which made me offers waiting until Google finally made a decision. This really was a negative experience and I think that there are serious problems with the hiring process at Google. Not only do they not feel bad about keeping the candidates waiting for weeks but also ask for other information such as references and team support letters which is pretty unusual for a hiring process for a new grad. Five onsite interviews is already a lot and it should be enough for them to make a timely decision.

I was found by a recruiter and he proposed to apply for an SWE position in Zurich or in Warsaw. This was the first phone interview. The interviewer asked me the main question (below). Afterwards he asked me another question: given a text, how would I find the most common letter in that text? What if the text is ASCII/Unicode? What if the text was only 8 characters long? After this interview they decided to have another phone screen with me.

I can't tell the exact questions, but all problems were related to basic algorithms and data structures. One problem involved a binary search tree, one involved dynamic programming, one was a 2 player game where I have to determine which player had a chance to win, one was about a binary search array, and one was related to some basic hashing.   Answer Question

I got contacted by a recruiter thanks to a referral from a Googler friend. First, I had a quick (5-10 minutes) phone call with a recruiter. I described my background and interests on a very high level. He didn't really ask any questions. Next day I got contacted to schedule a technical phone interview. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation. Technical phone interview was about 30 minutes long. There was only one problem, and I had to implement a solution in a shared google doc. In a few days or a week they contacted to schedule an on-site interview. I asked another month for preparation. There were 5 back to back interviews with engineers, and a lunch break in the middle. Each interview was 45 minutes long. All had very similar structure. There typically was one main problem, and an interviewer expected a simple brute-force solution to begin with. Then I was asked to analyze performance and try to optimize my solution (or in some cases scale it up). Finally, I had to implement a solution on the white board. Some interviewers asked me to implement the brute-force first, before discussing possible optimizations. Others wanted me to optimize the solution first, and then implement one of the versions at the end (they didn't care which version I pick to implement, just wanted to see I can code). If there was time left, we discussed another more challenging open-ended problem (on a high level, just to see how I think), or had time for me to ask questions. The problems were not too hard, but the interviews felt pretty intense overall. After the interviews, I got contacted by my recruiter the same day. She told me she got some initial feedback, and what she heard so far was really good. In a another 2-3 days she confirmed that the interviews went well and told me she will be preparing my case for a hiring committee. Finally, in about 2 weeks after the on-site interview she told me they are ready to make an offer.

Got a feedback in 2 days to schedule for another interview. This interview went real bad. The interviewer was pretty useless. Took a lot of time in explaining the questions and did not convey what result was expected from me. The process was assessment test + phone interviews(1 or 2) + whole day interview at Google Office. The HR recruiter was very helpful. He called and explained why they were rejecting my candidacy. Asked to send my resume directly to him the next time any suitable position comes up instead of applying online.

Typical 5 person on site with a mix of design and coding questions. The coding questions were pretty standard and had 3 of them. The disappointing part is that the interviewing seemed very mechanical. There was no real conversation where they actually cared about what experience you bring to the table. With the whiteboard coding they would tell you the solution is optimal and bug free but then the recruiter feedback was completely different, some of the feedback not being submitted until a week after the actual interview. With some of the interviewers, trying to get to what they were really asking for was like pulling teeth. Expected more from Google.

I was able to skip the phone screening this time I applied - likely because I had already been through that process before. I was invited on-site for a day of interviews. In total, I had 5 technical interviews, most of which consisted of technical questions around data structures and algorithms. One of the interviews was around my dissertation, however the person assigned for that interview was completely unaware of the topic of my work. He worked in programming languages and I do work in human-computer interaction, so it was not productive. There was also a break for lunch with one of the employees.

I have actually interviewed twice with Google, at two locations (Europe and HQ), so I'll combine the results of both interviews. As is noted here, process is usually three steps: 1. Initial contact call (possible light technical questions) 2. 1/2 VOIP technical screenings 3. On-site 5 x 45 min with lunch full interview day Most reviewers focus on 2 & 3, but it might be worth not forgetting that step 1 might throw a few scripted technical questions at you. It's certainly possible a strong candidate could be filtered out at this stage, if they make the mistake of coming into the call completely cold, and blanking on something not-entirely-trivial such as *worst* cases of the common sorting algorithms... I think also there is a large gap between the difficulty of the pre-screening and on-site stages. This may well lull you into a full sense of security. Also, the difficulty of the tasks on the day can also vary quite a lot. Some of my domain-specific questions were trivial, or at least that's because I'm, unfortunately, highly specialised. You will of course get plenty of low-level algorithm questions, including those somewhat dressed up to conceal the textbook techniques that apply. Also, it's highly likely that you'll be thrown a curve-ball or two; in my case I did get a reasonably "mathematics" question. Unfortunately, your ability to handle the pressure of the situation will have a *large* bearing on your success. That maths question, for example, coming at the end of the day, was a real killer. As a mature (30s) candidate who was an A student at pure math in his teens, it's a really disheartening to be flummoxed by something like this. I also had a design session the second time, which is nice because as a mature applicant - although with "only" 6-years in the industry - I would be hoping to be in lead roles. Good feedback from the recruiter, actually, since I made the blunder of not using a *very* top down approach. Perhaps it's easy to make this mistake, though, since a session like this is such a gear change from the rest, which will be decidedly bottom up. Organisation of the process was *fairly* good. I know the recruiter had some issues organising the interviewers, and this caused things to be finalised quite last minute. My second interview was moved closer to home as a result, which is actually a benefit. Interviewers were mostly well prepared and professional. The "vibe" in the interview is, of course, highly dependent on your performance. Sessions that go badly for you are likely to feel much less comfortable. I would put myself somewhat in the skeptic camp with regards to these kinds of technical interview processes. I have also interviewed at Facebook, where the process is very similar (although somewhat less academically oriented). Whilst I understand that these companies have their reasons for using this kind of process, it will be quite disheartening to a large number of strong candidates who hit that false-negative filter. In my own case, after a quite a few rejections trying to join a US tech giant through the coding avenue, I have to question whether it's even worth persisting. My suspicion is that these roles are for a "certaind kind of people", are skewed towards recent graduates and coding competition hobbyists, and "aren't for people like me". Personally, I have to consider carefully if it is worth pursuing future attempts, including constantly reviewing coding-challenge style material in my spare time over a period of 2/3 years now.

Was contacted by recruiter. He scheduled a phone (google hangout) interview and gave me lots of information about how to prepare, such as algorithms, coding, practicing to code in a google doc, etc. The interview itself was disappointing. The interviewer showed up 5 min late, didn't introduce himself and was overall a bit rude. He was holding my resume and it was pretty clear he just started looking at it. Never asked any coding or algorithms question, but rather very vague questions like "what have you done and what do you want to do?" The only technical thing was about parallel programming, how to create a new thread, but again the question was vague. I wasn't asked to write code but he also wanted a very specific answer, and saying things like you write a function for that thread and create a new thread passing that function resulted in him staring back as if I weren't speaking English.

I applied through an internal reference. I quickly was contacted by a recruiter who scheduled an initial video hangout screening. During the initial screening, the recruiter went over the general interviewing process and asked a few very easy technical questions. This was followed by scheduling a call with an engineer for a technical interview. The technical interview was difficult but not unreasonable, and the interviewer seemed to be able to follow everything I did easily, but they were not the most encouraging person. Be warned that they focus heavily on your ability to analyze the big-O run time of whatever you code.

I was referred by a friend who works at Google and I had applied for a specific position that they advertised. They called me within a few days and asked me when I am available for a phone screen. The phone screen started with another engineer asking me to type a program into a shared Google doc. While it wasn't a particularly difficult program, I found it to be tough going trying to solve it while on the phone typing in a Google doc editor. It probably took me longer than it should have and I don't think I quite had the boundary conditions just right. I don't know exactly what to say about the experience. Its entirely possible that it reflects poorly on my ability to program, however I have no doubt that it a program I can write fairly easily if I need to. I didn't get past this stage, but regardless I am told that further stages would have involved multiple interrogations and their Mountain View office.

On site there were six 45-50m interview slots - one was over lunch to answer my questions. Three of the interviews were about algorithm and coding, one was about previous experiences, and one was a high-level system design. Coding problems were not traps, but required thought and care. Two of my problems were on brute force transversal, one was a more complicated problem that required dynamic programming (which I do not think I got fully right). Over an interview, the requisites of each question would evolve, getting extra constraints or requiring extra complexity. Depending on the interviewer, they would only move on after you had your code in, so if you can put the algorithm in code form faster, you might be able to better show your prowess, because you would get to the harder items. It is a marathon, and that makes it harder. The questions would have been much easier if were done isolated. I guess it tests also your ability to cope with pressure. Overall was a very interesting experience. I have not heard whether or not I will have an offer.

I got an email response shortly after applying and then a phone screen shortly after that. The person said that it was possible to skip to the onsite interviews, so I bypassed the online coding interviews. After a while, I heard back from the same person; he said that the feedback was good from one of the potential managers, so I was assigned a recruiter to handle my candidacy from there. I had a 15 minute phone call from the recruiter explaining what the interviews would be like. I was given interview prep material, and I took about a month to prepare for the interviews from that point on. I also took advantage of a one-hour online interview coaching session provided by Google. I prepared by studying my college textbooks on data structures, algorithms, discrete math, and probability. I also used the online version of the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book linked to by Google's interview prep material for some practice problems, and I also used LeetCode for some more practice problems. On interview day, I had five 45-minute coding interviews using the white board and lunch with an employee after the first three interviews. A little less than a week later, I heard my results from the recruiter. He said that I was rejected and explained the positives and negatives of my interview performance. He told me that the next time I would be allowed to interview would be one year later. He told me that my interview performance was good enough that he would run by my application by some of the managers of other positions that have a little less focus on software engineering (such as a site reliability engineer). About a week later, I got an email from my recruiter saying that they were not interested but to reach out to him next year if I wanted to apply again. A few weeks later, I got an email asking me to take a survey about my interview experience. I found the people involved in the interview process to be friendly and professional.

This confused me a bit since I wasn't thinking in terms of a graph. He didn't seem impressed by my answers.

Before I dive into the interview process, my first advice will be to not confuse the timezone of your phone call. Unfortunately, I did and woke up at 6 AM in the morning waiting for the recruiter who was actually supposed to call me at 1PM. So the interview called me at the specified time. He skipped any question regarding my resume and present me with first question.

I was contacted by a recruiter to interview with Google again and got a phone screen setup about a month away from the initial call. During the initial call, I was asked simple questions about my current job, what I do, what I'm interested in doing at Google, and so on. On interview day, I was called pretty much on time from an engineer from Seattle, who introduced himself and told me what he did there. Afterwards we went straight to the question and I spent some time working on it. When I finished, he asked if I had any questions for him and then that was it! I felt like I did ok, but then realized I made a lot of mistakes as I thought about it more. So I expected a "no" when I got a call back. The major problem I was having with the whole process was the wait for the callback. I interviewed at the beginning of June and didn't get a call back until July. What made this more crazy was that my roommate interviewed with them as well and got a call in 2 days! In order to get this call, I needed to contact my Google friend and ask if this was normal, which was not. He pulled some strings and then I finally got the call with my expected result. Overall the process was ok. The wait for results was a little absurd though.

Was contacted by a recruiter a couple weeks after winning a university Hackathon (relevant because the recruiter said he found me through the event). Proceeded to a quick phone interview to describe the SWE role at Google and schedule a phone screen. The challenge was to code a really simple mathematical operation. Then I was asked to the solution recursive. Then improve the runtime. Then improve the memory complexity more. It was a fun exercise. Code was shared through a Google Doc. After the phone screen, I was invited on-site for 4 interviews. The onsite interviews went well enough that my application went to the hiring committee and they scheduled me for two additional phone interviews. I felt quite lucky to get here after reading about how the committee regularly discards applicants that they don't reach a consensus 'yes' on. However the interviewer in the first follow-up interview clearly did not want to be there. He was quite dismissive and tried to end the interview as fast as possible. The second interview went much better. It took two weeks for one of the interviewers to turn their feedback in. I can only guess at which one took so long. In the end, I didn't get the offer. I rated negative experience because the process took a LONG time. I was first contacted in early March and did not received the official rejection until mid June.

The interviewer called me through cell phone asked about my background and then get down to the coding interview. I wrote code with google doc. There were two problems. The first one is about sorted list. I provided a solution using binary search and also analyzed time complexity of my solution. The second one is about correcting a piece of code written in C++. Three days later I got an email from the recruiter telling me that I was invited to an onsite interview. They also provide a guide for preparation. The onsite interview was on their Mountain View campus. 5 interviews in total from 10 AM to 3 PM. Most of them are algorithm problems the interviewer could met in real work. One is about background and why you want to work at google. The last interview was two basic algorithm problems you could find on Leetcode.

Technical screen, followed by an onsite interview. One thing that stood out was the manager that interviewed me. This lady was dressed up much more than the other women in the office. She looked like she was going on a date - high heels, tight pants, curled hair, makeup - the works. She finished graduate school within the past five years (I finished graduate school 15 years ago) and had at least 10 years less experience than I did. As part of the interview process the possibility of me working as a manager came up. Ultimately Google decided I didn't have the past experience to justify a management role. I was offered a position as an engineer and I turned it down. Why? Because the interview panel itself told me what kind of "manager" google values. It's pretty clear Google values "eye candy" over competency - which means less possibility of career advancement for myself, or even more qualified people for that matter. Then again, Google's products, which have declined in quality IMO, reflect that. This company has turned into another Boeing or Microsoft. So sad.

5 interview questions (1 system design, 1 algorithms + api, 3 algorithms). I have solved (correctly) all 4 algorithmic questions and I think I did well on the broad question too. But in two of my interviews, I think I was just mediocre - i.e. I needed a hint in one, and didn't pay too much attention to a design of an API in the other (but to be fair, both guys were looking unhappy even before we started; they got rescheduled without a notice -- not my fault). I have to say I really had fun and even enjoyed the process, but luck was not on my side. My advice to you: pay attention to factors outside of the interview.

You can immediately check if your code is working or not through their compilers. 4) Technical interview involving phone interview & coding: you talk on the phone and code. Although the interview wasn't hard, I didn't particularly get what the interviewer was asking. I gave my answer, and he just repeated the question over and over again. It seemed like he had an answer in mind and will not budge to any answers other than that. I tried to ask to rephrase the question so I can figure out what kind of answer he wants, but no, he just repeated the question. I struggled with the interviewer for some time, and finally he just decided to give me the answer. I couldn't understand why that was the only answer, why he couldn't just take any other answers, or why he was so dead-set on this question without moving on. It was not a good experience talking to someone who just wants to listen to whatever he wants to listen to. Maybe other interviewers are the same, but this was by far the most confusing and frustrating interview I have had.

The interview process started with two rounds of phone screenings. They were pretty much what you expect, the interviewer asks you a couple simple questions then a slightly more challenging technical question. If you make it through the phone screenings you will be invited onsite for in person interviews. I had 5 interviews with a lunch break in the middle. Each interviewer can ask you anything they want but they are told to investigate some particular quality about you such as your problem solving skills, cs fundamentals understanding, etc. There will also be different questions if you have a lot of experience (I think they said it was 3+ years?). Then all your information is passed on to a couple committees who decide if you should get an offer or not. The entire process took ~3 months for me, but that is because I had work and had to space stuff out a lot more to be able to find a time that worked for both of us.

Recruiter and the phone interviewer were awesome. Onsites were terrible. No one really cared whether I'd want to join Google. 2 of the 5 interviewers were nice and people I'd want to work with. The system design person was really nice - and very smart. The first person to greet me from the reception was a bit cocky, arrived 10mins late from the interview time and didn't even bother introducing himself. During the interview he seemed rather bored and was checking out fb on his phone while giving me a tough question to solve - even though I was solving it correctly or thinking along the correct approach, I felt like he had a particular solution in mind. One of the other interviewers brought a tough question and the print out of the solution which he was checking with as I was trying to come up with the solution, or print out of the test cases and checking those in the list after asking me too. If this is the kind of interview questions they want to ask and isn't something the interviewer himself can't think of during the interview, they shouldn't be asking such questions. Overall I felt like I went to a cool fraternities where the people were more interested in looking down on me and making me feel like I don't exist (first interviewer). It seemed like people wanted to ensure the interviewee (regardless of their years of experience at other important tech companies) felt like their too lucky to be granted an interview. Terrible feeling as a interviewee - none of the other small/large companies regardless of how well know they are in the world make you feel like that.

The interviewer would talk to give a hint only if I paused for more than 5 seconds.

First a timed online survey with two coding questions, finished the first to my satisfaction, was unable to get any code for the second in the time frame. Got called within a couple days from a recruiter who set up a phone interview the next week. Phone interview consisted of two more coding questions. Got called by my recruiter the day after the phone interview saying they were interested in moving forward and transferred to a location-specific recruiter. Scheduled an onsite interview for two weeks later. From receipt of initial survey to notice of no offer, total process was about 7 weeks.     No overly complex or trick questions. All doable within the scope and time constraints of the interview, with help from interviewer for unclear areas. Focus on algorithms and run time of solutions along with thought process that went into forming the solution.

Recruiter contacted me a while back and then I followed up recently. They set up a phone screen where the interviewer introduced himself and then proceeded to ask me a technical question. He broke it down into the easy, medium, and hard difficulty portions. The problem was a little abstract and the interviewer had a bit of difficulty explaining it to me. It was part my problem understanding it as well. After I had a decent understanding, I was able to forge most of the way ahead through the easy and intermediate difficulty portions. He cut me off and had a briefly friendly chat. They said that my algorithms and data structures skills were good but my technical communication was lacking which is probably a pretty fair evaluation. The engineer was extremely friendly unlike some of the reviews that I was reading on reddit.

The whole process started with a very nice and helpful call with the recruiting staff who explained everything and answered all my questions. She led me through the whole interview process and scheduled my phone interview. At the telephone interview itself I got a call from an Google Software Engineer who was first of all upset that the hangout did not work which he told me was of course my fault. After that he gave me a rough coding question which I could not understand at all. After I've asked back a few times he told me could not help me at the interview. This made me not confident at all and I have to say I got a little bit nervous. Anyway, I started coding and tried to solve a problem which I couldn't really understand from the beginning. I tried to ask a few other questions, but I think the interviewer had some other work to do since seemed a little bit distracted. After I finished a first answer I told the interviewer a few times that I'm finished now until he reacted. He went quickly to my code and then told me that I have forgotten a some aspects I wasn't asked for in the first place. After 30min of stressful coding and asking back I finally figured out what was asked from me but this had required to change the whole code from scratch. So I tried to fix it with 15min left and coded as fast as I could. After exactly 40min (not 45) the interviewer told me that he had seen enough, said good by and hung up. In summary, I could not get what was asked from me in the beginning alltough the problem (a simple graph search on a regular grid) itself wasn't hard at all. Of course I did not get to the next stage because my answer was not good enough. I was really disappointed by the interviewer. He seemed not interested to tell me the question correctly and was distracted by something else. In my opinion this is totally inappropriate in an interview process.

There are two steps in the interviewing process: #1 - Phone Interview #2 - Onsite Interviews. The phone interview will last ~1h and a software engineer will contact you directly (via hangouts/phone). He will ask you questions about programming problems and general computer science questions (e.g., O notation). Be prepared! There are a lot online resources (e.g., the book "Cracking the Code Interviews") and it is just a matter of reading and practicing. If you feel comfortable with solving problems in online platforms (leetcode, topcode, etc.), then you won't have a bad time during the interview and it will be an interesting talk between two engineers ;) If you pass in the phone interview, then you'll be invited for the onsite interviews!!! They will arrange everything for you (filghts, hotel, travel expenses, basically everything). I was very well received at the hotel and I felt like being part of Google. The hotel receptionist told me things, like: "since your company is Google you have this and this and that. (...) Since you are a Googler, you can access that and that and that.." It was a very welcome reception and the best part was when I got to my room, I had a letter from Google with my name in it, saying "Thank you for traveling all the way to meet us!". About the interviews: they aren't easy and the interviewers will try to crack you up (I did crack in one of them... I couldn't do a simple DFS in a tree!!! A thing that I was really prepared for..." But it is just a matter of sitting down and breathe in and breathe out... calm down, it is the interviewer's role to try to crack you. :D Mainly you will have 5 interviews in one day, all of them will start with a problem, you can try to solve it with brute-force, but obviously that you have to reach to a better or an optimal solution. The idea behind the process is not to find if you had reach the final solution, but more on how you get through the problem and how you solve the in-between problems (like different inputs, race conditions, distributed systems, etc.). At the end, I must say that I was really really exhausted... However, it was a day to remember forever! It was a pleasure to meet everyone there, to be and see a Google office from inside and, finally, talk and share ideas with all the well-educated and fantastic minds of Google software engineers.

The recruiter contacted me via my LinkedIn account (Global Recruiter). I had a positive communication with the recruiter and she offered me some interesting positions in my field of Machine Learning. She scheduled me an on-site "Phone Interview" in Tel-Aviv office, which is the first basic technical interview. On the interview itself I was asked to solve an extremely easy algorithm problem - the kind of question you ask an high school grad who learned python, and later I was asked some general "what else, what else.... " annoying question. They didn't ask me anything complicated that I could have expressed my experience or knowledge, I did answer correctly on everything, it was pretty easy. I've waited a week for the negative answer from them, they've said that I was good but not amazing... And that they can't continue the process with me. I have worked for several huge corporates, I did some things in my life and I'm working in an amazing company as ML Algorithm design. The reason I accepted their offer was because I believed Google is the best place for AI researchers, but this recruiting process raised some serious red-light for me, and If this is how they decide if someone is amazing or not - I guess I should find a better place for contribute as a ML researcher.

four off site phone interviiews, one on site, did whole thing twice, recruiter last time was high pressure and kept repeating how they actually wanted two or more answers done per 40 mins onsite, felt like cattle especially when the engineers would stand right next to me and expect coding done almost without thinking, I have no clue what made me go through it twice but they really dont even realize how much their process sucks which makes it even worse. Sorry to share so negatively but it just was a horrible experiene. I tend to be reflective and iterate through code with many small experiments which makes my code super reliable, there was no way to show these skills and I ended up breaking under the pressure.

Initially, I got an in mail from Google's recruiter asking for me considering a position at Google due to my experience. I graduated CS MSc studies over a decade ago. I replied that I am unfortunately pretty busy now. After a while he contacted me again, asking if I am maybe available now, I decided to proceed, because I wanted to know what kind of projects they can offer. He then asked me few easy questions, next we have set up some tech interview call with an engineer. The following phone interview was surprisingly easy and enjoyable. After one week I received very positive feedback and was asked for on-site interviews to one of the European sites. We have set up not really distant date - 2 weeks later. I was informed that one-site interview will take 5 rounds and will be more in-depth and challenging. I was given also some materials, book recommendations. During these 2 weeks I did some preparations refreshing the general knowledge on algorithms, coding tricks and skimming through these book. But I didn't want to spend too much time on it, as it was barely used in my professional work, expecting that they want to evaluate my specialization anyway. Some time later, I have arrived at the site, I was welcomed by HR lady, very nice and cheerful and I was saw me to the interview room. Pretty small, no windows. I'd expect some more comfortable interviewing place from such big company. Then I was introduced to the first interviewer, I was informed that it is my fellow countryman. He briefly said hello, informed that we are gonna speak English only from now one and started writing some generic coding puzzle question on the board. No introduction, no chit-chat, no questions about myself or my experience. Overcoming the first impression, I first wrote a brute force solution (telling it's gonna be brute-force first). Once I finished, he took took a photo with his phone, then threw "can you make it better". I started giving some ideas, but he was just staring at me without any interest, finally he said he don't understand what I am saying, and gave a hint. I realized he wants a modification of some puzzle from the Cracking the code int, I did write the code. He again took a photo and left without the word. 2nd interviewer was nicer. But the 2nd question was again coding puzzle, nothing to do with my experience, quite similar to 1st one too. But at least this interviewer was giving me a feedback in what direction he wants to optimize, and soon we reached a good point, he said he got what he wanted, we had some less format chat. 3rd interviewer was 30 min late, it was only 15 minutes left of his time! We rushed in hurry doing some solution for caching DB responses. Nothing to do with my experience, again! It was simple in overall, but I had only 15 minutes to show my ideas. The interviewer was okay and matter-of-fact. 4th interviewer was asking me how would I design some Google specific stuff/system. Looked like a higher grade employee. And again nothing specific to my experience! We talked quite a lot, to came to the question if I know MapReduce, I said I heard of it, but not really. He said, "you've just described it". Weird! 5th interviewer started with pointing out that my CV is done in LaTeX, and he used to use LaTeX when he made his PhD (emphasizing PhD for some reason). That was the first time someone said anything about my CV. When I responded saying LaTeX is programmer friendly, he ignored what I said and just started asking an interview question. And again it had nothing to do with my experience, and it was 3rd coding puzzle this day. I was feeling really disappointed. Regardless of that, I started clearing out the details and assumptions, I gave the brute force solution and started optimizing that. I reached some point of optimization for read and write, be he said he now wants O(1) on write, not saying anything about read, I immediately gave him an answer, that was correct, but really ignoring the write performance. He seemed to be irritated. The interview soon ended and he escorted me out of the office and briefly said goodbye. And this was the end of the on-site interview. I left feeling really confused, it was nothing close to what it was supposed to be according the nice youtube videos. I walked a bit in the city and then flew back home. 2 weeks later I have received a feedback from hiring committee saying that my performance was "mixed" and I did code well but my answers could be some times cleaner and more efficient, so they don't decide to proceed. No details given what was exactly wrong. They said also I can re-apply in 1 year. Yeah, I cannot wait to do that. Or wait, I can. Altogether it was negative but very valuable experience. I guess it can work for a fresh graduate, or topcoder fan, but if you want to get a job done and coding riddles are no fun anymore, because life is more about that, this process can be surprising for you.

The first screening involved string pattern-matching. Essentially, you have an a array of words encoded in a specific pattern and you're asked to see if a given word matches a word in the array.

I was directly brought onsite after being referred by a Google friend. Recruiting team was very quick and helpful in scheduling and sending prep material. Onsite day: Five technical interviews. 4 coding related and 1 system design. I ended up solving 2 problems (first one easy/medium, second one medium/hard) in all 4 coding/problem solving interviews. Interviewers were great listeners. I didn't require any help from them; however, they seemed humble. The system design interviewer was a bit uptight and pushed me a lot, but in the end he smiled and seemed happy. Hiring Committee (HC) I had a couple of pending offers; hence my recruiter took my case to the HC within 3 days after the onsite. Got a thumbs up. I was asked to provide references, other offer details and current compensation. Speak with teams : I spoke with 4 team managers/directors after they showed interest in me. I picked a team.

Received the response from HR two days after I submitted the application on the company career website. The phone screen is just a programming problem easy to be solved with recursion. Starting from a vague problem, you need to ask the interviewer questions to make it clear, and this is also applicable to the on-site interview. The on-site interview is well-organized. It is kind of annoying to spend a lot of time on the travel from the east coast to the west and then back to the east, but the interview itself is a good experience. The questions were not as hard as I had expected but I still screwed the last one and I was almost exhausted at the end of the day.

To pick a specialty from a pre-determined list.   Answer Question

Apr 29, 2016
---------------
I was contacted because a friend recommended me. I went through 2 preliminary phone interviews with 2 different people, and everything went fine. I was asked to choose my specialty from a list, which I did. I then moved on to a technical phone interview. I thought the interview went very well, I was asked to write an algorithm that I had practiced and was fresh in my mind. I explained my thought process and why I made each decision. I was contacted with results a couple of days later saying that it went well, but they weren't sure of something. They wanted a second technical interview, so I agreed. The second interview was with a foreign-sounding lady. She asked me an interview question which I asked for clarification. She then randomly began asking me front-end interview questions which I was not prepared for nor one of my strengths. I knew the answer anyway. At this point I already knew the lady did not like me from the tone in her voice, I attempted to answer her question, and she became flustered because I was apparently not answering the correct question, after a little back and forth she finally let me write some code, and then ended the interview pretty abruptly.

Call from recruiter, they find me online. Then one phone screen. I failed the phone screen, the question I had been asked was related to bit manipulation. I never used it since first years of my bachelor studies which was around 8-9 years ago. I actually studied for the interview, but I was believing that getting a question about bit manipulation is very low probability given that we are not living in 1980s. It was a good challenge I updated my interviewing skills, but it is frustrating to receive questions that are irrelevant to you. I work on NLP. Btw, recruiters were really helpful. My negative point was related to phone screen. The guy was doing his job while interviewing me. I understand it when I ended up asking my questions several times. The question was not very hard, if you search with keywords that I indicated below, you can find it. I believe it is not an appropriate interview question. The programming interviews are about remembering the questions that you see before or not.

Started off with a screening phone interview with an HR representative. Once I passed the screen, I was interviewed by an engineer via the phone and asked to solve a problem, using Google Docs as the medium. You have to speak your thoughts out loud in order to get the interviewer to follow your train of thought. Once that was passed, I went through a grueling ~5 hour on-site interview with five different interviewers, with a lunch break in-between. Each interviewer put forth a single problem to solve, which was relatively straightforward to answer but contained an edge-case that was annoying to deal with. There was one exception, where I didn't quite understand what the interviewer was talking about (whether the problem was on my end or his, I don't know, but the question in general made no sense without prior knowledge of the larger problem he was trying to solve... it really lacked structure compared to the other problems put forth). Unfortunately, the quality of the interviews varied greatly. I thought two of the engineers conducted themselves very professionally, but one was on his phone 90% of the interview, one talked more about himself and his work rather than spend time interviewing me, and one seemed to lack any form of social skills. I had really high expectations going into the interview, and left quite disappointed. The entire process itself was actually quite fast; they did a good job expediting the process when I asked, and the recruiter who was handling my case was kind enough to return my call even though I was rejected (many companies will not do this).

I don't believe we're allowed to talk about the specific problems asked.   Answer Question

No phone interview - Direct Onsite. 5 Technical rounds concentrating on Problem solving and coding. 4 out of 5 went really well. The one interviewer from the start said he is going to be on harder side and asked a question which was so ambiguous that I could not understand. How does a system return different output for same input? Reasons for it. It turns out to be more on OS related one that combines probability and page swapping and threads. And he was very rude from the beginning and was constantly evaluating me and smirking. (One instance, when i asked him if i am proceeding in the right direction, he just gave a silly laugh and said 'I must know it and must not ask him'. I did not find it very professional from interviewers point of view ) But he also asked a coding question and I did solve it, but before I could improvise and look at all the edge cases the time was up. (I must also say all other interviewers were friendly and the problem solving went on more like a discussion) After the interview I waited for a month and also had a team match call with one of the teams that i interviewed with. So indeed I was very hopeful since it does not happen often. But the recruiter called me after a month to say hiring committee did not move forward. The feedback given was nothing solid.

Phone interview, followed by on-site. Honestly, I was expecting a much more interactive on-site, where I get to ask questions and get feedback on my thought process from the interviewer. Instead, 4 out of 5 interviewers had sub-par communication skills with extremely hard accents to follow. They wrote a poorly explained question on the whiteboard and seemed irritated by any follow-up communication including replying to simple clarification questions. I eventually solved all questions asked, although potentially slowly, and in one case, quite inefficiently. The lunch interview was not fruitful either, where I was matched with a person from an entirely different development team. Also, the whole process took place at a very remote part of the Google HQ that looked sort of deserted. I got a callback from HR the following week that I didn't do well enough but was encouraged to apply next year. I don't think I will.

Referred by a employee and get a letter setting a phone interview, almost immediately. The interviewer has accent and is a little hard to understand, but he is very nice through out the interview. Anyway, the interviewer was nice, and the questions are simple, if you think it in a simple way. Since this is my first interview and I am really not a CS student, it is fair I failed it. But still a little disappointing.

The interview comes with two questions, all about basic programming: revert the bit sequence of a number(32 bits), like 0100 0110 0000 0001 -> 1000 0000 0110 0010. Just a reminder: the interviewer did require the most efficient way of programming.   Answer Question The second question was a bit confusing. Suppose you have a facebook API, which allows you to access all one's friends. Can you find if B is connect to A through friend's network? say A has friends (C,D,E) and C has friends(B,G). Now A is connected to B. I did the second one with a 7 layer for loop first, 'cause I was avoiding overloading the memory with too much data. However, the interviewer seems not to appreciate that. But I did answer the following up question wrong. He asked what is the big O for my code. A map search is N(nodes)+V(edge). I did not know that, I gave a answer of N, which is close but not correct.   Answer Question

I had two phone interviews from Google. In the first phone interview the interviewer pasted a data structure from Python and brought up a question while I mentioned I will use Java or C++. The sound was not clear either. When I asked about the data structure he said he is not good in Python. I started to write code for converting the DS so that it fills the C++ or Java objects. This took a lot of my time and the interviewer did not mentions that I could skip it. At the end I couldn't finish because of the lack of time. When I told about this to my recruiter, he arranged the second phone interview and the second one went well. The recruiter told me that I was selected for on-site interview. During the on-site interview I had four interviews. The third interviewer who came in bare feet asked his question and it was vague. When I asked questions to clear things up he was saying that he is not feeling good and he should have taken the day off ...

Then I had 2 separate interviews with different interviewers. On both the interviewer asked first questions about me and my previous experience and then followed up with algorithm questions. I had to answer the questions with pencil and paper while explaining the process of what I was thinking.

Recruiter contacted me (using handgouts) Asked few simple screen questions regarding complexity, scheduled next interview. Then I was interviewed by one technical person (2 weeks for preparation). Failed last one. Looks like better to have a longer time to prepare for this interviews, spent more time on paper coding and care about complexities (did few stupid mistakes regarding complexities - no excuses for those). Bottom line - my fault, both HR guy and technical guy was ok.

The interview process is pretty straightforward. There were two back-to-back interviews. I was a bit surprised by the first one's fast pace and mess it up. The second one was much better but it didn't help. I was rejected by call and email. The first one is mostly some small questions like the derived classes, binary search and dfs. The second one is much more complicated. Obviously I could finish it in 45 min, so the interviewer directly ask me to write only key functions. At last we were still in short of time, so the pseudo code was also allowed. I'm pretty sure I did well in the second part.

I applied through my friend who is a Google employee. I've already had an interview last year and did pretty well, so my recruiter said a phone interview was not required. The interview process was organized pretty well, despite some small technical issues. The interview consisted of 6 sections: 1 system design section, 4 coding sections, and a lunch with a Googler. One interviewer also asked some basic knowledge-based questions. After a week the recruiter wrote me a letter and said the overall feedback was supportive and asked some extra information for a final review. After another week I received an offer.

The interview process was quick, before and afterwards as well. I applied online and I've been recommended by a fried. However the experience was a vary sad one: while I was describing the first solution that came to mind I have admitted that it is not the optimal one. The interviewer asked me to write it anyway. I started to write the code and after 3,4 minutes I realised what was the optimal way to do it. I asked two times if I should write the optimal solution, but the interviewer insisted to write the first one. After finishing the first solution in about 20 minutes, he thanked me and leaved the interview. ps: i have copied my c# (preferred c# cause i was working at that moment with c#) code in visual studio and executed perfectly fine! not even a single error. Just it was not the optimal solution, but again, he insisted that I should write this one. While writing the code, the interviewer seemed busy with some other things, didn't even hear some of my explanations. The most weird moment was when he got interrupted by someone else, in the office, and asked how much time it will take us to finish. He answered like 5 minutes but were talking by less than 15 minutes. I have received a rejecting email by the end of the same day with the classical " you are good and experienced and bla bla.. but you are not a fit for the moment". Anyway, I was expecting a professional interview at Google, but not! not even close..

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I spoke with him a few days later. I was told there would be an online timed coding test and arranged a date to take it. When that date came the recruiter called to arrange a technical phone interview with an engineer. The interview question would not have been difficult for someone with experience but it is very awkward to code in a google doc with someone in your ear and talk through it. A big tip from my mistake would be to talk to the engineer through your entire idea before starting to write your code.

I applied online and was contacted by a recruiter. First interview was with the recruiter. Google Hangout. He explained the interview process and asked some very easy technical questions. Pleasant conversation. Next step was the real phone screening with a Google employee. Now, I had quite some time to prepare so I studied well. I thought I knew everything. Binary trees, BFS, DFS, Dynamic Programming, Prefix/Suffix trees, Heaps, Hash tables, and so forth. I knew all the important algorithms and data structures and I practiced enough to know how to apply them in clever ways. I also did a lot of leetcode questions without much difficulty, including most of the "hard" ones. Despite all this I still failed the interview. Frustratingly, the question really wasn't that difficult. It didn't require any advanced algorithms knowledge. Without going into specifics, what needed to be done was to go through an array, for each index recognize one out of three cases, and update some variables accordingly. What went wrong is that I didn't take my time to think this simple problem through. Instead I started coding immediately, produced something messy, and kept on trying to fix this mess. Understandably, this didn't make a good impression. So, my advice to anyone facing the same situation is the following: First of all, relax. Don't be afraid to take some time to think about the problem before you code, so that you know what you're doing once you start coding. Also don't be afraid to stop, rethink, and start over, if you feel you got stuck. Apart from that, always think out loud and listen to the hints of the interviewer. Also, practice coding in a plain text document. I realized that I really got used to syntax highlighting and code completion and had a bit of trouble writing down code in a shared google doc.

I received an email within a week of applying asking me to provide a coding sample via an online service, which gave me 60 minutes to solve 2 problems in any major language. One of the problems checked for whether or not my solution worked, and the other checked for time complexities. The next day, I received an email asking me to interview. The first interview was more informal and non-technical, just talking about my past projects and what the process would be like. I was also asked to schedule my next (technical) interview. A few weeks later I got the call, was asked a little more about my projects, then asked to code (language of my choice) while the interviewer was asking me questions. A week after that, I was told that they would not be pursuing the interview process with me any further. That being said, they were always very polite and happy to help.

I was contacted by a recruiter over LinkedIn and set up a phone interview with her. This was just a simple talk about the position, what the process would be like, and if I was interested. Next was an online coding sample that had to be completed followed by two phone interviews and then the on site interviews. All the engineers I talked to were nice and polite and would listen and answer any questions I had after the interview. The recruiter was also very nice and answered all my questions either the day I sent them or the next day. I was also kept informed of my status throughout the entire process from beginning to end and received information from the recruiter the day after my interviews each time. Overall it was a very well done and painless process, if only I had gotten a an offer, haha.

I wanted to do machine learning, and he quizzed me on software engineering skills. He liked me and recommended they hired me, but we couldn't find a good fit within the machine learning teams.

The on-site interview had 4 rounds in total. 2 rounds was asked 1 questions each, the other 2 asked 2 questions each.

The process started with a call from a recruiter who got a feel for my background and then lead into an over the phone technical interview using Google Docs as a shared editor. A headset was required, as the phone interview was over the phone, but I needed my hands free to type into the editor. The interview gave me the question, and then left it up to me to work it out and talk through my thought process. Along the way the interview would intervene and ask me why I did things a certain way, or try to poke holes in my solution by pointing out edge cases I hadn't thought of yet. This went on for a whole 45 minute interview until I solved the problem and was then able to ask the interviewer questions about life at Google.

The interview process went according to how it is described online elsewhere. As I was local and referred by a current employee, the HR initial interview was in-person and pro-forma. The actual technical interview was a few weeks later, scheduled at my convenience. I prepared a lot but still found the questions very hard. I was able to write code for most of the answers, although in one question on recursion I got stuck and could not formulate the algorithm. The interviewee people were very helpful and friendly. I guess my answers where not quite the top-tier of software engineering that Google requires and I did not get an offer. But it was a learning experience and I expect that the programming studying that I did in preparation will make it easier for other interviews. To prepare I read the books: Programming Interviews Exposed (this was recommended by the HR recruiter) and Cracking the Coding interview.

Over the phone screening interview with a recruiter followed by 1-on-1 phone technical interviews. Adequate performance will result in a second phone technical; outstanding performance will allow you to skip the second. Advancing beyond that results in an on-site review day with several interviews and chances to talk to Google employees. Nervousness is expected during every step and mistakes will happen but you needn't be discouraged by them. Google focuses on having a low false positive rate, not making it through doesn't mean you aren't an amazing person.

2 rounds of phone screening. back to back.

Just went on adding and improvising.

First round: # A represents the set { sum list of numbers } 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ------like this A = [(2,3), (5,7), (9,10)] # B represents the set {another list of numbers } 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 B = [(1,3), (5,10)] These lists always have the following properties: * Intervals are listed in ascending order. * Intervals are merged whenever possible.   i.e. you'll never see [(1,3), (4,5)] because it would be merged into [(1,5)] 1. When we see a new event ID, we need to add it to the set. Write a function to add a number to one of these sets, while maintaining the above properties.

Google recruiter contacted me after applying online. One coding phone interview from Google Mountain View, CA office. Interviewer asked me thesis related question since this was Machine Learning related job, followed by a coding question. After 4 days interviewer pinged me with positive response and asked for on site interview. I was interviewed at one of the Google Germany offices. Onsite experience : Standard Google interview. 5 coding / design interviews, one lunch interview. Standard algorithms and data structures questions. two pure coding/algorithms questions. Two game solving questions. In one of them, after coming up with the solution, interviewer also asked me to design how would I represent the game and then code the solution. I could hardly code 30 - 40% of the solution.. One system design question where they asked me to design one of the Google search feature.. Lunch interview : Hated it! After the lunch, I wanted some time to be on my own. Just to gather up some energy after three exhausting interviews. I thought interviewer will leave me alone after the lunch but he was sitting in front of me, staring at me and waiting for my next question to answer. The only question I had was when will you leave me alone?! Overall positive experience. One thing that was different from all the other interviews I had in past was that interviewers weren't helping at any point. Whenever I was struggling, they were just sitting ideally, waiting for me to solve the question my self. Except that stupid game design/solve question, I was able to come up with the solution and then code it within 45 minutes.

I applied online (and I believe I also applied through my university's career site). They responded quickly and asked me to complete a coding sample. The coding sample consisted of two problems to be completed in 1 hour. The instructions explicitly said: "Do the right thing. We’re interested in your skills and do check for cheating, so please don’t use your professors’, coworkers’, or friends’ solutions or any other external resource for coming up with your answers to the survey or coding questions." So I used zero external resources. No documentation. Nothing. I thought this was appropriate since you don't get to look up docs during a whiteboard interview. The algorithms themselves were simple. The really, really hard part was not having access to documentation-- one can conjure up algorithms with just one's mind and maybe a pencil and some paper, but it is near impossible to conjure up the correct libraries and methods out of thin air. After an incredibly hard time guessing method names and the like, my time ran out and I was only on the first problem. I completed the problem on my own, using documentation-- 'twas a breeze. I thought to myself, "It seems silly that an easy problem should be made so difficult by lack of documentation." I contacted someone at Google and asked them to confirm that "any other external resources" included documentation. I was disheartened and surprised to find out that documentation was perfectly okay to use. I told them what had happened and they denied me a second chance but assured me that it wasn't a problem and that everything would be okay if I tried my best... So I was obviously rejected. It's silly, but it's my fault that I had not spoken up before I started the sample. I just thought "any other external resources" really meant just that and that there would be no exceptions to it.

I interviewed at Google in the winter of 2013/2014 and again in the winter of 2015/2016. The first time I applied I was a senior in undergrad, and I was contacted by a Google recruiter. Here was that process: - phone interview with HR (really just review what to expect) - technical phone interview with engineer - onsite technical interviews (4) and one lunch interview I felt I performed poorly on at least one of onsite technical interviews, and I felt two went really well. I felt all the material was extremely fair given review materials/advice provided by my recruiter. I was notified shortly after (1 week or so) that I would not be moving forward in the process. Fast forward two years, and I was contacted by a recruiter asking if I would like to re-apply. Went through the exact same process, however, this time I was approved by the hiring committee after my onsite interviews. I did not have any memorable "OMG I BLEW IT" moments during my onsite technical interviews; however, I did not reach optimal solutions for each problem and also made various, small mistakes here and there. After matching with a manager and finally being approved by the executive hiring committee, I was extended an offer. My advice to anyone applying is to always stay positive! Re-applying is always an option after a rejection. I felt that getting prepared the second time around was much easier; all of my prep from undergrad helped me get back up to speed with algorithms/data structures/ etc much quicker than I anticipated. Additionally, each time I interviewed I felt all the questions were extremely fair; the recruiters do a good job of giving you an idea of the material you'll need to know. Do your prep, relax, listen to your interviewer, and you'll to great!

Of all the companies I have worked at or Interviewed at before GOOG Interview has been an experience to remember. It is one of the companies I admire for its culture and accepting the differences in its employees. I applied through a person I was connected on LinkedIn and the response to my application was almost immediate. I have heard experiences of people who applied through the website and waited and waited but didn't receive the response, so for someone willing to get GOOG to answer your immediately this might be an option.....but I still feel GOOG to reach out to people applying through the online interface as well. My prep was rigorous, covered all aspects of Data Structures and Algorithms, Design , Time and Space Complexity and C/C++ Review. I went through an initial round of HR screening after which I was asked to choose between coming on campus for the coding interview. I opted to give the initial knock-out round on campus. The screening went into great depths of coding, design and data structures/algorithms(by a Senior Software Engineer at GOOG). The 45 mins interview went on for more than 90 mins. I believe I did well on this and I could tell it from the handshake of responses I received from the interviewer. It was a little surprising that the interviewer said that he hadn't read my resume, but I am person who looks for the candidate's ability to pick up from the place he/she is stumped so I propelled forward without being fazed by the questions following subsequently. The result was within 48 hours I received a call from GOOG to schedule an onsite...this time longer comprising of four more rounds, about 12 days later.

I cannot discuss the questions as they were a part of the NDA I signed. I can tell there was a huge emphasis on the design in my interview. The interviewers(All of them) started by an open-ended question, to which I asked many many more clarifying questions to understand the scope of the problem and come up with possible assumptions under which I operated and produced pseudo-code and wrote code. I was interviewed by a mid level Software Engineer to begin with, then another mid-level Software Engineer, then by a Manager and finally by a Team Lead with 6 years of experience in GOOG. I was particularly interested in this interview as he seemed to come with experience working at a company that dealt with code security. A stark difference between my previous interviews(Please see below I have had more interviews at GOOG before) and this was that I was being asked to clarify the design on purpose and being prevented from writing code and given very little time to write code. This felt very strange to me. Either the interviewers were new to the process or were doing so on purpose, I couldn't tell. I got a real sense that they liked me during the interview with the messages they were trying to send me in terms of the conversation they were trying to engage me in....giving instant feedback and making me feel very comfortable during the process(Initially). But there was a time when they were just giving a requirement tracing it back and the problem space was very complex and AMBIGUOUS(Several moments during the interview were racking my brain quite a bit and there was significant pressure put....all a part of the GOOG interview).....I wade through the requirements and tried chopping off the constraints a bit and gave justification as appropriate. I wrote code in almost all the interviews except the ones that involved design and only design into the depth. All my interviews on the final interview were more than an hour and 15 mins, the lunch interview was short and just a casual overview of GOOG with the person who passed my resume, she isn't from the background I come from. I was again stumped why they were asking me to have lunch on campus with this person, I guessed that they probably wanted to see how I interacted with a plethora of people with different job descriptions on campus. This was very surprising part of the interview. I could tell that the interviewers were very keen on trying to sell GOOG to me, the workplace, their shipping cycles, their code review strategy, who they get new projects and how they share space with Mountain View office and collaborate and work. Finally I was escorted by a Team Lead and we seemed to continue the discussion as a continuation to the questions asked in the interview process. They were very engaging design discussions and I got a sense that this was a company I could look up to.   1 Answer

1 simple phone screen to weed out wildly unqualified candidates - mostly HR questions. 1 phone interview - coding done in Google docs. This was a hard question dealing with dynamic programming but I happened to study this kind of question in depth at school. 1 day onsite - 4 interviews and lunch. First two interviews went pretty well, second two went pretty poorly. First was a modified path-finding question. Second was a very simple optimization question (given a string of text and a bunch of functions for finding the number of pixels for a given character and font size, find the largest font size for which the given string fits on the screen). Third was given a compression decoder, write the encoder (there were a ton of edge cases here, mainly simple, but many edge cases had their own edge cases). Last was a binary tree question (given a binary tree, find the largest subtree for which there are at least two duplicate subtrees within a given binary tree). There are simple naïve solutions, but they were looking for a very fast solution (as I left the interviewer told me the answer was to hash). Overall I felt the whole process was very fair. I didn't get the position, but I don't think I should have. My background isn't in software engineering, and they seemed to be looking for someone who studied CS specifically.

As many before have mentioned, it's the 5x-45min interviews where you're asked 1 to 3 problems to solve (the fewer, the more details they'll ask). Some perspective: This is my second round interviewing here and if there's anything to take away (from this and life in general) it's still a roll of the dice, even when a company tries their best to be consistent. In my case it was night and day between the two, the first time was crazy; half way into the process fire-alarm went off, one interviewer was late and came in about to collapse and one spent the first half searching his phone for a question. The second on-site (a year later) went off without a hitch. I was able to solve all the problems given, but with a few stumbles on my part a long the way. With one of my interviewers I got 2 questions I already solved (not with google) so I told him I already got it and verbally explained the solution [don't hesitate to do this, honesty is valued]. A few pointers: 1.) A few tricks to watch out for:         -Some interview will keep it going to you end. Don't allow time to idle if you solved it. Verbally state that you're trying to see if there's a better solution (again don't idle to long), ask the interviewer if they thing a better solution exist or if they have any other questions or just say that you're done.        -If asked for operation cost, it's rarely o(n), but the problem will give the illusion of it.        -When asked 'what data structure,' be aware they may be asking for a combination like linked list and hash map for quick modification and iteration. 2.) Be familiar with collection structures and their methods for your chosen language including the string object. 3.) Don't be afraid to isolate things that are more busy work and not at the core of the problem such as asking the interviewer to assume a certain helper methods exist (they obviously have to agree to it first) 4.) If you realize you're solution fails, let the interviewer know and why it does and either rework it or start over (it happens). Hoping your interviewer didn't notice is the worst thing to try. .... you can probably guess some of these pointers come from some stumbling points that I ran into. I'm planning another round with these guys in 6 months.

The interviewer was reasonably congenial and since it was phone interview so I did not know the interviewer. It was not very clear from the interviewer's side as to the kinds of answers that he wanted.

It appeared he had a set answer and was interested in something very similar.

There are two phone interviews. At the begining, there will be about 4 mins for you to talk about your resume. Then, you just start coding. The problems are basic algorithm problems. Once you get the result, you may optimize your code for better performance. So, before the interview, you'd better prepare for the data structure and algorithms.

Contacted in October, filled out a survey about CS interests/experience and scheduled the back-to-back phone interviews. One interview went okay I thought, one went quite well. Contacted two weeks later for a third phone interview. Another couple of weeks later, was told I was in the host matching phase. This was in early December. Waited two months, with regular check-ins to my recruiter, and never got a call from an engineer. They told me in early February that there weren't any "strong enough matches" and thus I wouldn't get an offer. It seems like they need to tighten up their process, and I should have just been rejected after the interviews. It was a shame I didn't even get to talk to a single project leader. It leads to me and quite a few others getting strung along for no benefit. My recruiter wasn't unhelpful, but gave me very little information during host matching except "keep waiting and keep your fingers crossed". They do give you decent resources to prepare for your interview and host matching process, though.

Overall: Disorganized, but friendly The interview process took a while, as I was strung across three different recruiter-type people. At one point, one of them forgot a scheduled phone call and apologized in an email, ending it with a "LOL." The interviews themselves seemed a little disorganized. I asked for a list of interviewers two days ahead of time, and Google said that there wasn't a scheduled list of interviewers. They also had one person interview me about my PhD, but couldn't (or didn't) find a relevant expert in my research area. And the interviewer they did find was not very polite or curious. After the interview, Google couldn't tell me when they'd get back to me with a decision (during this time, I was making another company wait), and eventually when they did get back to me, it was just a recruit who wasn't able to offer any useful feedback or advice. Google, if you want to improve the interview process, here are my suggestions: (1) Use a single recruiter as the point of contact (2) Organize your interviews better (3) Have an interviewer give feedback, not a recruiter

There were a number of separate interviews with separate developers through the day with a lunch-time non-counting interview. The questions were all about puzzles that you could easily look up (I had seen them all before in the various books), and only one interviewer at the end of the day in the last five minutes of that interview even bothered to quiz me about my unique skills, a specialty that I was told Google was looking for and why I even chose to accept the interview in the first place. I went through the puzzles, writing my answers using brute force solutions rather than jumping to the conclusion not only because I felt it fair but also because I began to see the whole day as a waste of my time since it became apparent they were more interested in playing games than testing my skills.

Each of the 1:1 interviews had some open-ended questions and some technical coding questions. I answered every technical question with a reasonable (i.e., not quadratic time), working solution, though that wasn't enough to get an offer this time. I can only assume there were more efficient answers than the ones I provided and/or they wanted me to get to the end result more quickly.

The engineering interviews were awesome. My interviewers were really nice and I felt like they wanted me to be successful. The process took way too long. There was a two+ week delay from resume to contact, a two+ week delay between contact to interview, a week delay from interview to notification success (!), which led to submission to a committee, which took two+ weeks. Finally, after the committee approved my application, I waited a week to get in touch with my recruiter, who explained host matching. By this time, I had been in the process for over two months. I accepted an offer at a similar company that offered a much much smoother process, more responsive recruiters, and significantly better compensation.

I can't give any details about the questions but it was a full day of interviews. Each interview was 45-50 minutes long and was technical, without being overly difficult. The interviewers were very good - it felt more like a collaboration rather than being asked random questions. There were two interviews in the morning and two in the afternoon with a lunch in between. The lunch was with a googler who was there for any general questions I had about working there. Of all the companies I applied to, Google has the most straightforward and balanced interview process.

I was contacted within a week of applying online, and a phone interview was set up for the next week. The phone interview lasted about 45 minutes. The interviewer was fairly unenthusiastic (known to be common during Google first rounds, since they expect most people to fail), and I'm almost certain was up and grabbing a coffee during my interview. The interviewer seemed eager to get it over with, and jumped right into coding on a Google doc.  I was asked to code a simple data structure and do some simple arithmetic involving for loops, so I knew I had the correct answer. I was asked if I had any questions following the coding for about 30 minutes. After the interview concluded, I waited two weeks, and had to bother the recruiter for feedback. I was told my interview was not reviewed yet, and that he would try to get that as soon as possible. There was back and forth for another two weeks and I was finally called by the recruiter to tell me they would be going forward with other candidates. He told me the feedback read that I answered the questions correctly, and my code was written well. He then told me to get more industry experience and apply again in 8-10 months. The big takeaway for me was that Google may act like they will take anyone if you are smart, but you should have quantifiable experience and a very solid resume to back it up, maybe even type something other than GOOGLE in the cover letter box.

The interview process involves 4 technical interviews, sometimes a fifth is added. The interview is focused around your ability to design solutions and solve complex problems. The focus is extensively on algorithms at lower levels. As you interview for higher level positions, the focus starts to shift more towards design versus algorithms, though the latter is still very important.

Standard - phone interview followed by onsite. Phone interview was easy and the interviewer was very courteous and understanding. Onsite was a mixed bag of 5 interviews and lunch. My first interviewer had some medical problem so he kept winking at me which made me uncomfortable - I couldn't focus on the interview a lot. My second, third and fifth interviews were great. My 4th interview had a newbie interviewing me and a senior experienced engineer overseeing him. The new interviewer didn't explain things properly and the senior experienced engineer acted so haughtily and muddled me even more that I got very confused. Overall, it was an okay experience.

I then had a 45 minutes preparation call with other candidates where they explained the process and everyone could ask question. I wasn't feeling ready for the interview and I asked to postpone it for 2 weeks and the recruiter agreed. The questions were not so difficult but I struggled in the coding challenge. I'm also a sophomore in college and I had to study myself some data structures and algorithm basic to be able to answer the questions properly.

Phone interview, then 2 interviews at a branch office close to where I lived, then some 5 interviews in a day in the office I applied for. Interviews are technical, be prepared to solve concrete problems, may involve coding, complexity of algorithms, system design. Interviewers are more or less free to ask what they think is relevant, so one interviewer asked about concrete numbers for how long a certain algorithm would run (i.e. expected some basic knowledge about typical hardware), others wanted to know complexity of algorithms or problems in concurrency, or what the most exciting thing was that I learned. If you write about what you did prior, be prepared to answer detailed technical questions about it.

I had a phone interview first. A guy from the Google map team, asked me about my background and then he asked a computational geometry question about polygons. After I explained the algorithm, he asked me to code it and test my code on a specific example. After I passed the phone interview, the recruiter contacted me and we scheduled for an onsite interview in Google Waterloo. I had 4 one-one interviews there. Each one was about 45-50 minutes. They asked mostly coding questions and less about algorithm. Honestly, I expected to see harder questions there, but they only asked simple questions that even a good junior student can answer. The questions were mostly about processing and manipulating strings. I managed to answer all the questions flawlessly.

I interviewed over the phone, and was not invited to an onsite interview. The recruiter reached out first - Google had my information from previous internship applications. First, I scheduled a 30-minute recruiter call (they give you information about the position you're applying for), followed by two 1-hour coding interviews, about a week and two weeks later. The coding interviews are done on Google Docs, so you don't get syntax highlighting. Be prepared! I programmed in Java. Questions are the standard type you would find in a review book. I used Elements of Programming Interviews in Java to prepare. I was asked to schedule the second phone interview a few days after the first one, being told: "The interviewer thought you were very bright but has suggested another phone screen." During the technical interviews, my first interviewer did not ask any questions specific to the SETI position (i.e. testing), but my second interviewer did ask such questions. A few days after the last interview, I was told: "The interviewer thought you were very bright, but we would like to see a few years of industry experience first."

Got contacted by the recruiter due to doing well in Google code jam. After a few calls and verifying internal references, I was able to skip the phone screen process, and the onsite was scheduled a month out.

Had two interviews on campus back-to-back. Overall vibe was that it was very organized and methodically thought out - we were given the two rooms that our two successive interviews would be in. First interview was tough. I made the mistake of jumping into a solution without thinking it through all the way (probably because I was a bit too excited) and it ended up costing me in the long run as my interviewer pointed out a few edgecase issues with my algorithm after I was done (and I finished barely in time after running through a few issues and modifying my algorithm throughout). After i finished my algorithm I had to write code on whiteboard which was annoying. Second interview was much the same but I was much more calm and relaxed, which led to me doing much better. Knocked the question out of the park in my opinion and had my interviewer scrambling on what to do next since I finished so early.

Applied online, then had two phone interviews over a Google Doc. They were the typical interview format: they started out talking about what they do at Google for a few minutes, asked me a few questions, then gave me the question. I was later scheduled for a third phone interview, though I think they can make hiring decisions after just two (I did really well on one and just mediocre on the other, so I wasn't surprised that they wanted to see me do another interview). The third interview's question was harder than the questions I had gotten in my first two. Overall, it was a pretty painless process, and Google's scheduling is very streamlined.

Google I was contacted by a recruiter within two business days of applying through a referral. I scheduled a technical phone interview for about 2.5 weeks from then. I could've scheduled it for earlier but I wanted to spend enough time studying. The interviewer called me more or less on time and we stayed on the phone while working with the same Google doc. I did a simple warmup problem for 10-15 minutes and then went into the main problem which was a rather abstract dynamic programming graph problem. The phone interview is intended to be 45 minutes total but I went over an hour. My recruiter let me know within 24 hours that I will be moving on to the onsite. We scheduled a phone call and she explained in depth what the rest of the process is like, and also covered some housekeeping details like my current location, type of work I'm interested in (front end, back end, mobile), and projects I'm interested in as well. I scheduled my onsite in MTV for two weeks after this (again, it could have been just a week after, but I wanted ample time to practice more), and my recruiter also scheduled for me a Google Hangout coaching session with an engineer for the following week, intended to help candidates prepare properly. The onsite went smoothly. I had two interviews before lunch and two after. My last interviewer, in particular, extended the reservation for the room so that I can finish the full code for the problem, which was rather complex. Everyone I interacted with (4 technical interviewers, lunch interviewer, recruiter) was really friendly and I actually felt pretty relaxed throughout the whole experience. The recruiter was able to collect all interview feedback within 4 business days and called me to let me know that the Hiring Committee will be reviewing my case the following day. The next day, I found out that I had been recommended for hire! It took about 4 business days after that for the VP approval, compensation approval, and SVP approval to be completed, and an additional day for me to actually receive the offer letter. I was told that having a competing offer made the compensation approvals take longer than it normally would have. Other than how long it took to receive an offer after the onsite, the overall experience was pretty well streamlined and I had a great time. I signed two days after getting the official letter, and will be entering the project matching phase soon. Notes on preparation: I prepared for technical interviewing nearly full time for about a month. I reviewed my old data structures book from college, made sure I knew the particulars of the programming language of choice, did all problems for the data structures, recursion and DP, and medium & hard sections from Cracking Coding Interview, and did most of the problems on Interview Cake. I got a LOT of whiteboarding practice and made sure I analyzed every problem for space/time complexities and also considered alternatives solutions and the corresponding trade offs.

A recruiter contacted me inviting me to submit a resume and transcript if I was interested in working for Google. The recruiter got my information from an internship application I submitted last year (I was never contact for an interview for this internship), so this just goes to show that it never hurts to just submit an application. I went through the phone interview and then was flown out to the YouTube offices for the onsite. After my onsite interview, however, the recruiter told me that while I wouldn't be moving forward in the SWE process they felt I would be a really good fit for their Engineering Residency Program, and so if I wished to be considered for that I would just need to complete one additional interview (over Google hangout). The recruiter was able to schedule that interview within the next few days (I had an impending deadline and the recruiting team did an awesome job accommodating my schedule). After this final interview I waited for a week until I was notified that I had gotten the position. In general all three rounds of interviews were of the same format (though some had one or two behavioral/program fit type questions). I would definitely recommend going through problems in Cracking the Coding Interview/leetcode/hackerrank. Know your data structures (emphasis on hash tables and graphs), know how to figure out space/time complexity. The recruiters will send you a study guide, so definitely go through all the topics listed on that guide. Lastly, throughout this whole process I've come to realize how much of the outcome of an interview comes down to sheer dumb luck. Luck in the fact that an interviewer will ask you something that you just practiced the day before, or something relating to your course work, or that it turns out you have very similar interests as your interviewer and you just click. So sometimes it just might turn out that despite all your preparations the interviewer just happens to ask you something you are super shaky on. There really isn't any way to prepare for any possible question that you could get asked, so just remember to breath, stay calm, and ask for help if you need it!

I was contacted by a recruiter roughly 2 months after completing the 3rd level of programming challenges on foo.bar. The recruiter was nice, but it was a bit frustrating the he did not take the time to read the application materials he had requested (resume and transcripts). When we talked on the phone it was clear that he was just scanning my resume for the first time. I ended up having two technical phone screens. Both engineers that I spoke with seemed distracted and apathetic. The second was particularly frustrating: the engineer was talking with a third party the whole time, and at the end when I asked him what he thought of the code, he raved about my performance. Then, come to find out, he doesn't even recommend me for an onsite. It was super frustrating. I left feeling like they made little effort to actually evaluate my qualifications and ended up wasting a bunch of my time. I think a lot of their process depends on the luck of the draw with who you interview with.

Apart form coding, they will ask you other problems and simple questions form core subjects of computer science, so it will be great if you brush up your concepts.

Details of technical Interviews : First telephonic Interview : She just said one line that she was calling from Google-MTV and works for Google Search. Period, No more, no Less. She was sounding a bit frustated and it was appearing as if she doesn't want to speak. When I was giving the most optimal solution also(I knew it was, had solved that same problem previously) she seemed to not tell anything, I asked her twice whether I should code it up, but she preferred not to answer, so I jumped into coding it on the shared doc. After finishing the solution quickly, she just said that she was done and asked if I want to ask some question, I was feeling terrible by her behaviour by this time, so I just said NO, she hang up the phone after words, by just saying OK. Second Interview : He was a cool guy, and for the first 10 min, he mentioned about him, and told me that he works for Google Wallet, and his previous work experience. I asked me 2 algorithmic questions, and was satisfied and impressed with my solutions.

I started the interview process by getting an email from a recruiter through LinkedIn (Many people at my college also got the same email). First interview was a standard phone screen where we went over my resume and summer experiences, any questions I had about Google. Then scheduled a technical phone interview. I went to Google alumni talks at my school consistently to network and ask questions and received news that they would be skipping my technical interview and flying me straight onsite. Once there, I had two 45 minute technical interviews, a casual lunch with a Google employee (not an official interview), and two more 45 minute interviews. Questions were quite creative and a little more complicated than the average algorithm or data structures questions. Entire process took close to 2 months, but with self scheduled time in between to help me manage my academic life. Recruiters were quick to respond and everything was handled very smoothly.

Phone interview: 1-2 mins of introduction and small talk, then onto the technical coding questions which were described to me over the phone as pasted into a Google Doc. You code your solution underneath it. The interview consisted of 2 questions. The questions are not hard, just be sure to thoroughly explain what you are doing. Do not simply code what comes to mind (this was my mistake) and think it over and talk about it. Once you have a "sufficiently optimal" solution, begin coding. You may want to type out pseudocode while you work up to this solution so you can have an easier time when it's time to answer.

Very straightforward process, phone screen with HR, technical interview over the phone and then an on site interview. Unfortunately, the interviewers are sometimes incredibly incompetent. For the technical interview I had this guy who not only called me 10 minutes late, but also seemed to be in some ridiculous hurry to get the interview over with. On top of his hard to understand accent the man was a complete trainwreck at interviewing and did not understand basic things that I would explain to him. He also did not understand the C++ STL at all and thought that maps in C++ do not initialize objects even though I decided to work around his misconception and assume that objects in maps are not initialized. When I got the interview feedback back, through someone working at Google because heaven forbid interviewees want some feedback on their interview (Sick one btw, Google), the incompetent interviewer thought that I didn't understand the C++ STL even though I was correct! On top of that, he commented that one of my solutions for one of my problems was wrong and then said that a valid solution would be X, where X is LITERALLY THE EXACT SAME SOLUTION I GAVE TO HIM JUST IN CODE FORM. Needless to say, I absolutely do not trust the Google interview process and would not recommend applying to a company that houses such arrogant and incompetent interviewers who have no idea what they're talking about.

I was referred by someone at Google. The original process was great. I was contacted by one recruiter and had two 45-min technical interview. The recruiter got back to me a week later and told me that I would be handed to another recruiter and that they would like to have an additional technical interview with me. Then the nightmare began. There were two weeks of silence and I had no idea who my new recruiter is. Then I missed the phone call from the new recruiter and when I tried to call back, no one answered it. A few minutes later, I got a rejection letter from the recruiter. I was surprised and asked her what happened to my additional tech interview. She told me that she did not notice that I still have one interview and she started a new application for me to reschedule the interview. The next week I had the interview and waited for more than two weeks before she called me to tell me that I got rejected. I guess that the interview experience really depends the recruiter you have. So good luck! Wish that none of you need to have some one send rejection letters twice during one interview :(

I was contacted by google through my school's recruiting program. I had two back to back 45 minute in person interviews. Both of the interviewers were very nice, very professional. One interviewer's style was a little annoying, every time he would ask a technical question, I would answer and he would just smile at me, not indicating whether or not I was correct or on the right track. First interview was mainly one question, asking me to write a copy-on-write string. The second interview was a couple of little questions, followed by asking me to combine two iterators that are sorted, keeping them sorted. The whole interview process wasn't bad at all. I made a very silly mistake on the iterator question, eventually getting it, but they probably expect a perfect response for such an easy question.

Applied through University website. Got an email to arrange a phone interview. I was given a link to a google doc just in case I was required to type code. Unfortunately I was never asked any coding questions. The interviewer had a very heavy Indian accent and I had extreme difficulty understanding most of what he was saying. When I asked questions, he did a poor job of answering them and sometimes changed the subject instead of answering my question. I feel I simply had bad luck and got a bad interviewer and it cost me a chance at a job.

I was contacted on LinkedIn by recruiter. Then I had a phone screen with the recruiter going over the interview process and timeline.  I then had a technical phone screen with a Google engineer. The first time the Engineer failed to call me at the scheduled time. We rescheduled and the phone screen consisted of a brief chat about my background but mostly focused on solving a problem using trees. Since I had a deadline the next week for another company Google was quick to fly me out to Mountain View for the onsite interviews. My onsite interview consisted of four ~45 minute interviews with Google engineers. There was also a lunch interview, in which they don't gather feedback which was supposed to be with a 5th person. He did not show so I went to lunch with my 2nd interviewer. This could've been intimidating for some candidates but is not the norm and since I got along well with my interviewer it was not a problem. Each interview was based around a programming question. There were absolutely no questions about my resume, background, or interest in Google. Coding was done on a whiteboard and they expected code to be compilable, although I was able to use pseudocode for some generic helper functions. All of my interviewer were highly intelligent, polite, kind, and seemed excited to be there. They gave me very useful hints when I ran into issues with my solutions. I did not meet with a recruiter or receive a tour of the campus which would've been nice. There wasn't any effort "selling me" a job at Google but this might have been due to my tight deadline. Overall a good experience and it seems like Google creates a great environment for their employees.

I got the interview opportunity through employee referral. After about three weeks, I got in touch with my recruiter and then set up time for two consecutive phone interviews. I had two phone interviews with Google. Because my focus is on Machine Learning, in the first interview, I was asked a coding problem then an open-ended problem about Machine Learning. In the second interview, I was asked two coding problems. After one week, I received an email saying that I passed the interview.

Three coding problems, all about basic algorithms and data structures. Another open-ended Machine Learning problem, but also basic.   1 Answer

Question from Cracking the Coding Interview   Answer Question

Oct 31, 2015

I submitted my resume online, and got a call back within a few days. Recruiter asked me some brief questions about my experience and scheduled a technical phone interview. This interview involved writing code in a shared document, and the question began fairly basic (finding a sequence in an array with certain properties) but became more complex as I answered it (what about in a tree instead of an array?). Recruiter let me know I made it through the phone screen after about a week, and scheduled my on-site interview. On site interview was five 45 minute whiteboard coding questions, with a lunch break in the middle. The questions were challenging, but similar to those I had studied. After that, There were a series of committees that had to approve, and the recruiter filled me in along the way.

First off, you must know that the recruitment organization at Google is run by complete and utter morons. Recruiters get hired and fired all the time, and almost all of them are completely useless. Trust me, I have interacted with a great many of them. They may not be bad (or dumb) people, but the environment in which they work makes it impossible for them to do a good job. It is completely normal that they forget to call you, forget your interview half way through, reassign you to random people, or to positions which you are clearly not qualified for. Almost every single person working at Google has a story regarding recruiter incompetence which affected them or one of their friends. Now that that’s out of the way: you either apply for a job (usually via our website), or a recruiter contacts you, usually because they found you on linkedin (or similar) or because someone referred you. Then a recruiter looks at your CV (more on your CV later), to weed out the people who have obviously no business working in IT. If you have a suitable degree (e.g. BS in CS, EE, math or physics), or a few years of experience, or are a contributor to some well-known open source project, then the game can begin.

I went straight to the onsite interviews because I had a referral. There were four standard technical interviews with reasonably friendly engineers. Halfway through I had lunch with an engineer who barely said anything. Before the onsite they gave me their list of specific topics to study, but those didn't end up being especially relevant to the actual interviews. It took about 3 weeks to hear back after the interviews.

Google recruiters are pretty aggressive (in a good way). I created a LinkedIn account earlier this year, and within 48 hours I got a phone call to discuss interview opportunities at Google. I was surprised they called me, because I didn't make my number public on LI. Turns out, I had applied to Google 7 years back on their online portal. They never called me back then, but my information was lying around in the system. So now I can confidently say that Google called me back 7 years after I applied, LOL! Anyway, they were pretty happy with my resume/background. The recruiter actually offered to skip the phone interview, and directly call me onsite. Score! We set something up a couple of weeks later. I keep my coding and algorithms skills up to date, since I participate in competitive programming, so I didn't need to prep too much. I think I reviewed mainly the system design portion, because I hate those questions so much! Onsite was a great experience. Funny story, I was waiting in the lobby on the day of my interview. The doors opened, and in walked my co-worker (from my current job at the time)! He did a double take when he saw me, and we both just burst out laughing. Turns out, he was interviewing on the same day, and we didn't know about each other. The interviews themselves were a ton of fun! 4 out of 5 were coding/algorithms, which is my passion. The interviewers are very knowledgeable, and we kicked around many ideas on how to approach various problems. I got through (solved and coded) about 2 problems per interview. Of all the companies I interviewed with (LI, FB, Google) Google's interview was the most thorough in terms of CS areas. They hit all the major CS areas (dynamic programming, recursion, data structures, randomized algorithms, greedy algorithms, systems programming, graph theory, BSTs etc.). I was expecting this, but the thoroughness really surprised me (especially since other top companies only have 2-3 coding modules). On the flip side, they didn't ask a single thing from my resume (even though I was 10 years experienced). That was surprising as well. Luckily both my coworker and I made it through. I will be moving there next week. My advice for Google interviews is to make sure your algorithms/DS are solid. In addition, coding should be second nature. Once you solve the problem algorithmically, writing code on the whiteboard should be completely mechanical. I think most people that interview there are smart enough to make it through, but many fail due to lack of preparation/practice.

I was contacted through e-mail initially to set up an initial phone screen. The HR person was very nice and welcoming and the phone screen was just basic questions about my interests. She set up a technical phone interview for a month after the call. When the date reached for the technical phone interview, there was a mix-up with the time and my original interviewer was unavailable. Then, they had to reschedule me to a couple weeks later (very frustrating). Finally, I have my technical interview. The interviewer did not seem interested in me at all and he jumped right into the technical question. It was a bit challenging to do on the spot for me, I made minor mistakes but felt I had showed off my thinking style. I did not move forward.

I've only done the initial recruiter interview and the phone technical interview. There is an on-site interview but I don't expect to be called in for that because I did poorly on the phone interview. The recruiter interview was nice -- I was just asked about my interests and why I applied for the position. Pleasant experience. The phone interview was disappointing. I spent two weeks studying very complex algorithms as suggested by the recruiter, and I was prepared with an arsenal of facts and knowledge about data structures and algorithms and LINUX systems and networking and the list goes on. Then, I ended up spending the entire phone interview on one relatively simpleton problem, getting stuck in the nitty gritty details of how to move an index and offset around. It was the kind of question that most programmers could usually do in their sleep, but I was nervous and just jabbered on. The interviewer was nice and polite, but overall I feel the interview style structure is poor and needs to be more varied (how does a blind scientist know that he's touching an elephant if he only feels the toenail?) Based on my experience, I strongly recommend doing Project Euler problems or the like ... although I went through dozens of them and they didn't help me. Theoretically, though, they will. Anyway, bottom line is, don't worry about understanding complex subjects. Just worry about the basics.

Had a phone screen with recruiter and then a technical phone interview with an engineer. Then invited to onsite and had 5 back-to-back whiteboard coding interviews all with senior engineers. Still waiting for the final decision.

NDA so cannot disclose the questions. The questions I had were much more difficult than what my friends had and what people posted on websites like glassdoor, leetcode or careercup. They were about algorithms and data structures but far far away from obvious. One of them tested if I knew some arcane number theory stuff which I of course didn't. I would say the questions I had required much more than just the basic stuff that you could find in a typical algorithm book. I managed to solve them with the help of many hints from the interviewers, so I think I will not get the offer.

I applied online and got an email from a recruiter. She then set me up for a phone interview with a Google Engineer. The interview was completely technical. The question had to do with making three vectors that represented a sparse matrix. The engineer was pretty helpful.

Sparse matrices are usually stored by only storing the non-zero values. But, there is no single standard format for doing this. One such format is called Compressed Sparse Column (CSC).

Didn't make it past the first phone screening which surprised me since while I didn't have my hopes up for getting an onsite, I at least expected to get to the second phone interview. The recruiters were very friendly and nice, and genuinely seemed to want me to do well. My opinion on the actual interviewer was neutral bordering on the negative. It wasn't that he was rude or blew me off-- it was how uninterested he seemed when he interviewed me. I also didn't like the interview question, but it was definitely fair for a phone screening (mine was BFS-related in a matrix, but I won't get into details because they'll probably reuse it.) I ran out of time while coding in the document, so we couldn't discuss code errors, runtime, trade-offs, etc., which I thought was kind of unfair. I'd rather have half-finished code while being able to demonstrate that I knew what I could/would have done rather than only having somewhat complete code to show.

Contrary to a lot of stuff I'd heard about the inefficiency of the Google process, the interviewing process went really well for me. Started with a recruiter who goes over all your basic stuff and resume checking stuff and gives you a list of material to study. This is followed by 1-2 phone interviews and then an onsite if you make it past the phone screens. The resources given by the recruiter and all of the stuff you can find online are more than enough to succeed at the interviews. However, you have to remember that they pick the smartest people in the world. Personally, I did not make it past my first phone screen. However, I was offered an interview with their Engineering Residency program which sounds promising. Will update with a review for that after it happens.

I was first contacted by a sourcer through Linkedin. The sourcer asked about what I liked to do and tried to see if there would be any teams or projects that would interest me. He let me skip the phone screen and went straight to scheduling an onsite interview. He then transferred me over to a recruiter that was based in Mountain View. This all sounded like it was going smoothly, but, oh, how wrong I was... The interview itself was challenging but not impossible. I had five interviews, plus a lunch "interview." If I remember correctly, there were three interviews before lunch, and then two after, each 45 minutes long. I think I did well in three of the interviews, and two of them I only did okay, maybe a bit below average. I was originally applying for a front-end software engineering position, so two of my interviewers had a few questions focused on the front-end, e.g., CSS, Javascript, event handling, etc. The other three were generic software engineering questions, that you would find in a typical interview. All of the interviewers were very nice and I didn't feel uncomfortable asking them questions, although there's a chance I might've asked too many questions. After the interview, my recruiter told me he would have an update for me by the following week. After a week goes by with no updates, I send him an email only to discover that his email address was no longer active. After some frantic emailing, I found out my recruiter had left for another role without telling anyone, so I was then assigned to another recruiter. Recruiter #2 was very nice, but for about three months, all he could tell me was that they needed more information in order to make a decision, and was very slow to get more information (e.g. asked for references, but didn't contact them until two months later). He eventually set up some project calls for me with four teams, and that went very well. I sent him my preferences of the teams, but he went on vacation for two weeks, so my application went nowhere during that time. He informed me that he was leaving for another role after he got back, and I would be assigned to yet another recruiter. Recruiter #3 (who was awesome, by the way) told me that the hiring committee's schedules were weekly, and so I had to wait a full week between each of the remaining steps for any updates. Because this took so long, the hiring manager of the team I was supposed to be placed in had left for another role (there's a common theme here), and so I had to have more project calls to find another team. After all of this I finally got an offer. I'm not exaggerating that the entire process, since the first message sent by the sourcer to when I got the offer letter, took six months. This was one of the most frustrating hiring processes of my entire life so far. (And maybe in the universe? Who knows?) I still took the job, though.

I won't go into specifics (not that I'd remember them), but for the front end questions, you should be very comfortable with selectors and how to manipulate the elements on a page. There was also some Javascript-related questions about events. For the general engineering questions, I would say it's important to be comfortable with problems regarding 2D arrays (things like boards, keypads, etc.) and graphs/trees. Definitely know your big-O runtimes, since you WILL be asked for those, and how to optimize your solutions.   Answer Question

Recruiter contacted me for a phone screen. I then had a phone interview and a few weeks later had an onsite interview. Overall, the process was quick as I had a pending offer with another company.

They very much expect you to impress them and do not do much to impress you in return. I am a firm believer that the company should also try and show you how great they are as well.

A recruiter contacted me via email, expressing interest for an iOS position due to my work I've posted online. Recruiter was very nice and extremely helpful. Everything was great until I started the interview process on site. Was told I have several interviews on campus (4-5) and that two of them we're Data Structures, two we're iOS Development related, and one was structure related. I ended up only having four interviews when the final decision was made. Alongside this, I was also told several times that every person interviewing me was an iOS Developer. Sidenote: all interviewers were very nice, don't be nervous just go in there and be yourself. Make sure to communicate well. After interviewing with all four candidates I found out that two we're not even iOS developers, and one interviewer was a hardware engineer. This was a major disappointment. I expected more relative questions to the platform that I was brought on to specifically interview for, not general software engineer questions. If I knew this was the case, I would've gladly studied up far more on data structures that aren't commonly used in iOS development. Secondly, saying that two we're data structure focused and two were iOS focused was a complete fabrication. All four we're implementation interviews that we're focused completely on data structures and how to optimally use them to complete a problem. Again, I prepared thinking that I would get questions relative to my competency using iOS development tools, instruments, and programming paradigms alongside general CS fundamentals, but instead I just used data structures to solve problems. When this isn't stressed in what the recruiter says you need to study, it will definitely hurt you on interview day. Though I'm not sure how this pans out for a general software development position, but for an iOS position this seemed to be the case. All the silicon valley companies say to pick-up this book called "Cracking The Coding Interview", which if you're going for an iOS interview I'd probably pass on unless you want it for the practice problems. The book stresses mastering O(n) notation, space / time complexity, and testing, which are all topics that we're literally not even hinted at during any of my interviews. I was only asked one question about iOS development and wasn't sure why I was asked because even a novice iOS developer would have no problem answering it. Something I cannot stress enough is to practice, practice, practice all your data structures until you're blue in the face. When you're doing practice problems, which 100% of my interview was graded on so I'm not sure why you would study anything else, make sure to time yourself. Fourty-five minutes seems like a long time but it'll go by fast. Ask a few clarification questions and get to coding a simple solution immediately. The faster you get a working algorithm on the board, the faster you can optimize it. Know all the trade-offs of each data structure and if you're given a structure with the data ahead of time, do as much pre-processing as you can. I seriously cannot stress that point enough. Another thing the book stresses is to write syntactically correct code while whiteboard coding. Though this is a great point and I love it personally, always always ask your interviewer if they care about syntax. During my interview, it was a toss-up as to whether or not they wanted syntactically correct code. I'd practice how to write syntactically correct whiteboard code, but don't stress on it (as I did / was told to do) because 1/2 my interviewers we're focused more so on the implementation than the syntax. Without syntax, you can do some massive shortcutting and get an algorithm optimized much faster so always make sure to ask your interviewer. Overall it was a great experience and I'm looking forward to interviewing again. I was just disappointed with all the misconceptions that we're given to me about the interview process. Hopefully I've covered everything and this helps your performance. (:

NDA of course, but just know all your data structures backwards and forwards. Know how to use them together alongside which structure is best suited to solve a bigger problem. Do all the practice problems that you can find, because this will give you the biggest advantage in your interviews. They linked me the 4th edition of Cracking The Coding Interview which is great for practice problems.   1 Answer

I was referred by a current employee and was able to bypass the phone screen. They were very flexible with scheduling and I wanted to study a bit so I scheduled an onsite (the first of two) about a month out. I received an offer for another software engineering job and upon notifying my recruiter we were able to combine the 2 hour and 3 hour interviews into a single-day 5 hour interview. At the onsite there were 4 interviews total. The first was a design question. It was intentionally severely underspecified. I had to design object-oriented data structures and an algorithm to solve the problem. Once I solved it the interviewer upped the difficulty by changing the problem parameters a but "what if the entire input won't fit into memory/on a single machine". This pattern was typical throughout the day. Two of the remaining interviews were typical algorithms questions such as those seen in Cracking the Coding Interview. The last was a distributed systems design problem with no programming. I had to design a system from scratch, focusing on scalability, reliability, and performance. Once the interview was over I had to wait about a week for the hiring committee to meet. I'm not sure how much this was sped up by already having an offer. They met and gave the thumbs up. This wasn't an offer, but according to the recruiter was almost as good as one. I then met with the managers for three teams that were potential starting teams. These meetings were only 30 minutes so it was tough to decide. I then ranked the teams in order of my preference and sent that to the recruiter. I had to wait for the compensation committee, which was about another week later (6 days I think). I then got the official offer and start project over the phone from my recruiter and via e-mail. They gave me 5 days to respond, although I'm guessing this would have been flexible. I accepted the offer after picking a start date.

Submitted CV. Heard back from a recruiter. Quick telephone conversation with recruiter. She was really nice and helpful. Basic questions like favourite programming language, then she explained the process. Got an email asking for technical interview dates I could manage as well as interview tips and advice. Was very thorough and useful. A week and a half later telephone interview over Google docs. Was given a problem and asked to write a Java program to solve it. Then built on top of the problem for specific cases that might arise eg. how would you transmit the output over a network. Technical interview was around 35 minutes with 10 minutes of questions. Recruiter rang me a week later, told me I was borderline good enough but still rejected. Was asked to keep in touch and try again soon. By far the nicest recruitment process I have been through. No useless typical interview questions and everyone was very helpful and kind. I look forward to trying again.

Google reached out to me after finding my resume in the GHC resume database. The process took around two weeks. I had two phone interviews while coding on a Google Doc before receiving an offer. They were very quick to get back to me. First interview had a little about me telling about myself before diving straight into coding. Second interview was only coding. Both interviewers were very good and responsive. Phone interviews were back to back. I did find it strange that I was never asked to do an on-site interview.

You should never disclose interview questions. If you do, they will end up on a banned list, and the interviewers who know how to use those questions as discriminators for hiring will be forced to find new questions that they are less comfortable with.

After the initial phone screen, which includes technical questions and a peer coding exercise, I was invited for an on campus interview. This includes multiple technical rounds which include system design, and white board coding. What is most important, especially if you are an experienced engineer who has not interviewed for some time, is to study core data structures and algorithms, and to practice coding on a white board. I used the Algorithm Design Manual and the CLRS Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms as study guides. Its Google, the team was great and super intelligent, but I ultimately selected a start up for my next, and current opportunity. I won't go into offer details, but I will say that turning down a Google offer is very difficult.

Straightforward. Two rounds of phone interviews followed by several host matching interviews. Phone interviews were just recursion, nothing surprising.

Overall it is not so hard to land an internship at Google.

First, I have not actually heard back yet, but I had to fill out the offer field - it means nothing yet. Overall, the interview process was smooth - I would say that I enjoyed both of my phone interviews. I heard back about scheduling interviews only a couple hours after I applied, which may be due to me emailing my school's Google recruiter and a former TA who has worked there the past couple summers putting in a good word for me with the recruiter. Google's interview process is overall pretty well-documented and organized I think.

I was contacted by a recruiter to interview for a software engineer position at their Mountain View headquarters. I went through two technical phone interviews and was invited for a day-long interview at the Googleplex. The entire process for me was about 4 months from the initial contact to the onsite interview. I was given about 2 months to prepare for the first phone interview. In the end, I did not get the job. But getting the chance to review all the CS stuff I've learned over the years was extremely valuable. I also picked up some things as well. If you decide to go through the interview process, I recommend you take it seriously. I believe I am a much better computer scientist as a result.

I was contacted by a recruiter (internal referral). I had two runs of phone interviews and an on-site interview. The on-site interview was very tiring but challenging. I think I was lacking the confidence to present myself as smart. This came from being too focused on solving problems, I even stated out loud how proud I was for finding the solution to a problem (which did not help my case, I was just so excited). Thus I think it is important to stay on top of your game and look/sound sharp and smart during interviews. I have a PhD in computer science and had also a mini thesis defense interview. This part of the interview consisted of defending my research against an other expert in my field (AI). It was challenging and I was not prepared for this as I focused my preparation on the CS interview questions. So PhDs please be prepare to defense your thesis! I am currently preparing to interview there for a second time.

I was contacted by a recruiter looking for recent college graduates. I sent my resume to the recruiter, and soon had a technical phone interview set up for two weeks later. The recruiter sent me a couple documents with information on how to prepare, but they are very broad and not exceptionally helpful (maybe they are more helpful for the on-site interviews). My phone interview was 45 minutes long and consisted only of three coding questions, which I had to provide solutions for in a shared Google Doc. The questions were a little bit out of the blue for me, and since this was my first technical interview, I was largely unprepared. I highly encourage working on coding challenges, like those on TopCoder or CodeChef in order to prepare, since my interview didn't involve problems that involve "standard" algorithms and techniques (I didn't need to code up a quicksort or Dijkstra's or use dynamic programming, etc.) so it's good to have preparation in a diverse mix of problems. The recruiter called two days after the interview to say that they were not going to move forward.

I got two rounds of telephone interviews, each 50 minutes, finished in a total of 2 hours. It seemed that they would have many algorithm questions, but I had time only enough to work out 3 of them. Other than working out the problems, the interviewers were more interested in knowing how I approached the problem, how I could discuss my thoughts with them, how well I knew about its time and space complexity, than how fast I could code or how perfect the code would run on any machine. Preparing a good headset for phone interviews is extremely important because with both hands typing you won't have a hand to hold the phone for talking.

They asked me matrix operation questions and a tree operation question.

I was referred by a Googler. After two days, the recruiter contacted me and asked a few background questions and scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview was pretty simple. There were two coding questions which were even easier than a computer science 101 assignment question. After a week I got an onsite interview invitation. I only asked for one week to prepare for it, which turned out to be very stupid. I should have asked for more time. They flew me to Toronto and rented me a car. I drove to Waterloo from the airport, which took about two hours. If you get an onsite invitation from Google Waterloo, I highly recommend you to book the trip directly to Waterloo, especially if you are not familiar with the traffic around the Pearson airport. The interview was on the next day. There were five of them, three in the morning and two in the afternoon. There was no break between interviews, so don't drink too much water...The questions were similar to those on Leetcode, nothing special, but there was a system design question, so be prepared for that. One of the interviewer was not well prepared. He was going to ask a system design question, but someone before him already did that. So, he made up another question, which was messy. I can't tell details about the questions, but practising on Leetcode or other OJ will help. One suggestion for onsite interview is to think thoroughly, especially corner cases, exceptions and so on. Don't wait for the interviewer to point out the problem for you.

I chose early October to do the interviews since I required extra time to prepare for my PhD proposal defense at the end of September. The first interview went relatively smoothly. The interviewer asked basic Python questions like what list comprehension is; what the time complexity of a very algorithm. Then he asked me to write some simple modules. I think anyone who are familiar with computer science could do it in minutes. The second interviewer did not call me in time so we rescheduled for another day in the same week.

After initial HR interview, technical session with a Googler. The whole process took two weeks it was pretty standard for Google. Received feedback a week after interview. The initial interview was basic questions to determine why you want to work for Google, why this position and just in general testing if you have a pleasant personality. The second interview was a phone screen with 25% of the time spent on general data structures and algorithm questions and the remaining on a live coding exercise.

(modified to avoid nda) -- we have 10 billion files on a system out of which some are defective. Let&amp;#039;s say we can easily tell if a file is defective by its name (you don&amp;#039;t have to scan the content let&amp;#039;s say there is a blackbox API can can give you true or false result for an individual file). Design and implement a program that can provide the most frequently occurring defective files. You can assume file names are unique. You may not assume the number of duplicates is small.   1 Answer

Contacted by a recruiter who saw my LinkedIn profile. Very brief phone screen with an HR representative, followed about a week later by a technical phone interview with a Google engineer. He called about 7 minutes late, had a very strong accent, was using a phone with a poor connection, and did not seem to be focused on the interview (I could hear him getting Facebook messages in the background). He also presented several things incorrectly, such as initially calling a list of numbers a set, which implies no repetitions, but later changing his mind to just a list. I eventually got the question right, but it took the entire length of the phone call and I believe there was another question that he wanted to ask. He also did not give me the 7 extra minutes at the end and kept reminding me that we were almost out of time. A few days later I got a call from my recruiter telling me they decided not to move on with the process. She gave no useful feedback and did not ask for nor seem to care about my feedback. All in all, I thought it was a fairly unprofessional experience and will probably never interview with Google again.

The interview process was quiet exhausting & one can find people from various academic backgrounds attending the interview. The average length of the interview process is somewhat like 30-40 days with mostly 5 interviews. Of course, getting a job at google is not at all easy. You have to be the best in your field of study to clear the interview.

I first got in touch with a google recruiter via LinkedIn, and from there I was scheduled for a phone interview. This interview was a 45 minute technical interview in which I was given a coding problem and had to write code on a shared google doc while speaking out my thought process with the interviewer over the phone. Once I passed this, I went into the New York office for a series of 4 in person 45 minute interviews. Unfortunately my first interviewer showed up 30 minutes late, which threw off my schedule. But each of these 4 interviews followed the same pattern as the phone interview except that now I was coding on a white board. Overall the interview process was great and has been a good experience for me. Unfortunately I fell short of an offer, but it was still a pleasant process.

A recruiter reached out a number of times to see if there was mutual interest. When I finally responded I was interested, I was given an over-the-phone technical interview. The interview was broken down into 3 parts - implement a solution for some arbitrary problem, come up with test cases for it, and then list the smoke tests for some google product. After that, the on-site interview consisted of 5 back-to-back technical interviews. There were no real drink, snack breaks - except for a brief 30 minute lunch. The interviewers were rather impersonal so the prospect of working with some of them didn't excite me.

I applied to Google through my university's online job portal. I was contacted by a recruiter a few weeks later. She asked me about my classes, projects and if I would be willing to move to Mountain View. She also asked me for my programming language preference. She then scheduled the first phone interview. I did reasonably well on the first phone screening but I didn't completely nail it so they scheduled a second phone interview (instead of flying me off for the on-site). My second interview was borderline and the recruiter told me that they will pass over my application for now. She encouraged me to get some industry experience and contact her again in 12 months. The recruiter was pretty nice and helpful. But she had a habit of responding to emails late. A week or more. Overall not a bad experience. The interview questions were reasonable and the interviewers themselves were also helpful.

First interview - Warmup: The interviewer asked me a series of short questions. The running time (best, worst, average) of various sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heapsort. He also asked me about hash table and hash functions (average and worst case complexity of insertion, deletion and lookup). Central Question: Consider a setup where a program is continuously receiving floats as inputs (a stream of numbers). The task is to write a method that at any given time returns a moving average. That is the average of the last k numbers received. If the method is called before the program has received k numbers, simply return the average of however many numbers have been received thus far. The solution should obviously be optimal. Second interview - Warmup: Given an array of integers, write a method that places all the zeros at the end. Main question: Consider an interface which has the following two methods: interface Counter {   void inc();   int getLastMinuteCount(); } The method inc() is supposed to help keep track of the number of requests that clients make to a server (or something else along those lines). The getLastMinuteCount() is supposed to return the number of requests that the server has received in the last minute. The question is to implement a class that has these two methods included.   2 Answers

All interviews (phone and on-site) were the same kind: the interviewer introduces himself, presents some algorithmic problem to write code on a document or a whiteboard, and then 5 minutes to ask the interviewer questions about the company, etc. I didn't get an offer but the experience was good, the recruiter kept me informed at all times and was very friendly.

I was contacted by a recruiter in May for full time opportunities. I had interviewed before for an internship and January but I did not get an offer. The recruiter told me that she found my resume in their database. Since I wasn't prepared to interview at that time, I asked my recruiter if I can give my phone interview in July. The recruiter agreed and asked me to remind her in June. I reminded the recruiter in June and I was scheduled for a phone interview in July. The recruiter gave me lots of topics to prepare. They mostly covered all the basics of Computer Science I studied in my undergraduate and graduate school. The phone interview took place using a shared Google Doc. I was asked 2 pretty simple questions which I coded and tested within 30 mins. However, there was a huge communication gap between me and my interviewer. The interviewer was not a native English speaker and was not able to understand my explanations. I was pretty disappointed as I thought that I messed it up even though it was no fault of mine. (Note: This was the only negative experience throughout my process and it was completely overshadowed by the positive experiences later). The recruiter called me the following day and told that they wanted me to have a second phone interview as the first interview was inconclusive. I scheduled the second interview a week after. This interview was also on a shared Google Doc and my interviewer told me that the interview will be in two parts, one about CS fundamentals and the second would be some coding. For the first part we did not use the Google Doc and I was asked many questions about Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity Analysis. The questions will seem very easy if you are well prepared. The coding question was also pretty simple. Two days later I was told that I have cleared the round and they want to schedule my on site interview at Mountain View. I scheduled my interview a month later and the recruiter gave me a lot of material and links to refer for my preparation. The recruiter was extremely helpful and she even wished me luck a day before my onsite. The onsite consisted of 4 technical interviews and a lunch with an engineer. The lunch was not evaluative. All the 4 interviews were white board coding and they tested my coding, algorithm and basic computer science skills. The interviewers were extremely nice. At the end of the day, I was feeling very happy with the level of discussions I was able to have with the interviewers. My recruiter called me about an hour after my last interview to inform that she had already received a couple of interview reviews and they look pretty positive. 3 days later, my recruiter told me that she received all the interview reviews and the comments were very positive and that she would be sending my package to the hiring committee. I heard back from my recruiter about a week later that the hiring committee has approved my application and it will now go for compensation and executive review. A week from there, my recruiter scheduled a Hangout call with me where she explained my offer. :) Even though the entire process was spread over months, it was a really pleasant experience. My recruiter was exceptional and she replied very promptly to all my emails and kept updating me regularly at every step of the process. Now I am looking forward to join Google the coming year once I graduate.

The interviewer was 15 min late to the phone interview. Did she even take the interview as seriously as I did? We started the coding question right away. The interviewer seemed distracted the whole time. There were things dropping, loud thumping, and sudden noise coming from her speaker from time to time. Very distracting. The session was not enjoyable and pleasant. I was expected to autopilot through the whole thing by myself. The interviewer did not provide any direction as to what to do next. I felt I was conducting the interview instead of being interviewed by. I had to ask her if providing an optimized solution is what she'd like me to do next. The whole time was just me talking and every now and then yes, no, or a short sentence from her side. There was no elaboration. I did not sense she was enthusiastic about giving an interview. For the most part, she was silent. I was not sure if she was happy about giving an interview at all? Toward giving the optimized solution into the 25-min session, I've asked to provide guidance toward getting the optimized solution. Nothing helpful was given. I struggled until 30-min mark. She called time's up then. So it was just a 30-min interview. She expected me to solve the optimized solution without any help. Of course, she've asked this question many times so the solution would seem obvious to her. She expected the answer right away. I wouldn't be surprised if she's already written me off a lot sooner.

Google conducts 5 interviews hosted by developers across various teams. You meet with your recruiter in the morning and do a couple interviews, have lunch with an engineer, and then complete the balance of the interviews in the afternoon. The primary focus at Google is on computer science expertise. I was asked very few questions about prior experience or what sort of roles I was looking for. The interviews continue to expand in scope, so you typically use all the allotted time and don't have much if any time for questions at the end.

Onsite interview: arrive the day before and stay one night in an excellent hotel. There were 5 consecutive 45-minute interviews with lunch after the 3rd. 1 of 5 is about system design. All interviews are 1:1. There is no soft / HR interview; I did meet the recruiter but only very briefly. 3/5 quite OK. 1 so-so with a mistake. 1 pretty bad. For that one, the interviewer didn't state constraints / how fast it should be. This is different from competitive programming where sometimes large constraints can help you think about what solution is required. Only 1 out of 5 interviewers asked a soft question like "what would you like to work on" After 2 weeks I heard back from the recruiter stating that they have new information. Then, the verdict was communicated by phone. From the soft feedback they gave it became clear that they had read through the individual reports of the interviewers, but they don't tell you that you are too stupid. They said you need >= 4 out of 5 "good" results in the interviews and that I got less. Got the cynical advice "practice problem solving a bit more", nice if you are red in TopCoder.

2 45-minute technical interviews (either on-campus or on the phone) A week or 2 later recruiter tells you if you get into the host-matching process. If you get in, then you fill out a preference form for what you're interested in/skills/preferences for locations etc. Potential managers or hosts review your information and give you a 30-min interview if they're interested in you where they describe the project and you get a chance to ask questions. Potential managers tell recruiter if they want to move forward. Then you're allowed to decide if you want to move forward with the current team. If not, then you wait for other potential managers to contact you. There are cases when people in the host-matching stage don't get matched.

Interview process was very traditional. One of the project member warmed me up with some basic questions, mainly focusing on high school physics' concepts. After probably 15 minutes, the main interviewer walked in with a laptop asking quite similar questions to the first interviewer, in addition to some soft questions. Overall, I believe it could have been a successful interview on two accounts- 1) I should have meditated before I walked in. :) 2) It would have been nice, if the recruiter didn't try to hide the team/project information, so the candidate can prepare ahead to the type of mindset is required to solve those problems. First question/comment out my interviewer mouth was- "so, you know which project you are interviewing for, right?" In any case, it was a positive interview experience. Both of my interviewers were highly professional and patient through out the interview. I would definitely apply for another position at Google.

Asked a friend to refer me internally. Was contacted by recruiter within two days. Since I was local and had a referral, phone screen was waived and I went straight to the on-site interview. Google offers an interview preparation class. Although it doesn't cover anything groundbreaking, it is still worthwhile to attend. On-site loop consisted of five 1:1 interviews and a lunch. Lunch is your chance to ask questions about the company and environment. You are not graded on it. The actual interviews had algorithms/data-structure questions and system design questions. I also got the feeling that questions about your past experience weren't that important either. They were just a way to help you relax before the real questions. Sharing specific questions is against the NDA is kind of pointless. Google question pool is large. There are many specific questions already posted here on glassdoor. I went though roughtly 100 interview descriptions here with specific questions and didn't get any of these questions during the interviews. Doesn't mean that that time was wasted - this was very good practice. For the algo questions - just know your data structures and basic algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should do just fine. System design questions focus on designs Google-scale distributed systems. I suggest reading up on MapReduce and similar things. Study or practice with modern NoSQL distributed storage engines, know where usual bottlenecks are and you should do fine. Also read up on the materials that Google recruiters recommend - they are relevant. The "anti-loop" thing can be real and you can fail the interview even if you are well qualified. I was told that people really interested in working at Google should plan on interviewing 2-3 times. Then came the awkward part - negotiating the compensation... For whatever reason Google wanted me to commit to joining before sharing the numbers. While this was going on I got offers from some other companies in the area and this has finally forced Google's hand and compensation numbers were shared with me. The numbers were extremely good (having a few competing offers surely helped). But in the end I decided to accept an offer from another company. It was a very tough call since, based on a lot of data, Google is a great place to work at. Unfortunately one can only work in one place at a time.

First off I'll say that there was a huge language barrier between my interviewer and I. He did not speak fluent english by a long shot. The choppy google voice connection mixed with him being fairly quiet didnt help either. He asked me questions like "What does it mean" when pointing to pieces of code, which I answered by explaining what that line did, which was not what he was looking for. In the beginning he also said to ask him any clarifying questions along the way, which I did. I had to repeat myself multiple times and he had trouble answering them in a way that made much sense to me. They are definitely looking for CS Fundamentals. Algorythms, data structures, runtimes, etc. You code in a Google Doc and they dont allow you to run or test your code, so you have to be pretty confident about writing the problem out correctly top to bottom. They didn't care at all about my practical (real world) software development experience, and instead only focused on academic CS fundamentals, as listed above. I even specifically asked if my industry experience was relevant, and they said no. So, in a way, I dont think it would have been a good fit for me anyways.

Prior to this round of interviews, I had 3 technical phone interviews back in January that allowed me to proceed directly to onsite this time. On site I had 4 technical interviews where I wrote code on a whiteboard, 1 interview discussing my PhD research and how I could apply it and my skills to Google, and I went out to lunch with another employee so I had the opportunity to ask questions about the culture, projects, environment at Google. Overall experience was good. All interviewers were very nice and if I was stuck, most knew how to give a hint by asking a question or providing an example that my solution may or may not handle. Recommendations: Of course, brush up on all your coding and algorithms, and practice writing on a whiteboard if you can. Also, be sure to optimize your whiteboard space as you write! Make sure you go in there knowing how the work and experience you have done could apply to Google. For me, my interviewer and I never seemed like we were on the same page so this could have been hurtful to me. Downside: I asked my recruiter for any kind of feedback as to why I wasn't made an offer and so that I could improve my skills, but she did not give me anything.

First, there was a phone screening. The first part of that was coding in Google Docs. The problem could be solved with a simple greedy algorithm. We briefly talked about its complexity and moved on to a rather open question where we discussed upsides and downsides of different approaches. After the phone screen, I was in Zurich for five onsite interviews. Four of these consisted of programming exercise that had to be solved on whiteboard. It was usually: sketch the solution, implement it, can it be improved and how to test it. One interview was focused on design. The interviewer asked me to design a part of the system he was working on himself. A back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate the feasibility of the approach seemed really important to him. There weren't any trick questions or puzzles.

They did their job well. It was a great experience coordinating with them. The interviewer seemed to be in a hurry :).

The process was similar to others. I was able to skip the phone interview and went directly on-site. They had an event planned out for all the interviewees that day, so the overall interview experience was good. The recruiters I worked with were great and helpful. They were able to assist me in everything I asked. There were 4 technical interview sessions, 3 of them were fair but one of them was very unexpected and caught me off-guard. I was told that half of my interview was going to be about front-end stuff, since that's the role the recruiter said they are trying to fill. But none of them were, and one even asked very low-level stuff.

One of them asked me about the classes I took in college since I think he went to the same university. He then went one by one and asked me questions about the classes I was able to say. He asked about cpu cycles and bunch of other low-level stuff.   1 Answer

Interview process took a very long time, apparently there were issues moving data around on their end. Reading between the lines suggested that one phone interviewer either did not submit feedback or was delinquent in doing so. Overall accomodations were very nice, logistics, lodgings and transportation were taken care of extremely well and with a minimum of fuss. Interviews were 100% technical and basically asked nothing apart from coding questions. Interviewers (engineers) were a bit stand-offish and half were not too sociable.

Like many software-development-oriented interviews, I was asked about previous projects. As a recent graduate, I had only a handful of relatively small projects under my belt.

A Google recruiter emailed me out of the blue. After three times of declining (1 month) since I wasn't that interested, I was contacted again so I thought "heck, sure, I'll take an interview". One week later the flew me to Mountain View for the on site. (Gotta admit Google is very generous about the whole travel arrangements! Free hotels, flights, meals, car rentals, etc)  The whole experience was very pleasant for the most part. Got the offer 1 week later. The entire process, from initial phone screen to when the offer was made, took two weeks. One thing I'd like to call out and hopefully someone from Google recruiting/interviewing committee would take note is that they perhaps could do a better job at training their interviewers, not just from a technical standpoint but also from other nom-technical ones, especially on "normal" common sense and human interactions. I know we here are all nerds and as such could be a little awkward, which I totally understand. But one particular interviewer made me extremely uncomfortable during the interview since he kept staring at me like there had been something weird on my face and made excessively long eyes contact. I had to look away multiple times. Even when I was explaining my solution which is ON THE WHITE BOARD, he still stared at my face. The person's questions were good and had indept follow-up. So while I'd say he is a good technical interviewer, I still couldn't get over the awkwardness. This is no doubt thr weirdest interview I've ever had. Another minor thing I forgot to mention is that Google make you stay with your host at ALL TIMES. Even when you need to go to the bathroom which could be right next door, the host would follow you and stand at the door waiting for you, which is a bit awkward when you're a woman and your host is not.

Signed NDA so no details here. But I can tell you if you review fundamental CS concepts(sorting,graphs, trees,etc) you should be fine. Just make sure you really understand what you are doing. I don't think they would ask you crazy questions on obscure data structures. Just basics problem solving skills. Also try to be original and honest when it comes to nom-technical questions, such as "why Google?". Don't try to be unique and make up some weird reason. Just tell the truth.   Answer Question

I have participated in the foobar contest, resulting in a message from a google HR manager. According to him, the foobar was just for the initial connection and did not affect the overall hiring process. The HR manager described the hiring process in details and sent me a set of educational resource for preparation to the interview(s). When I've studied the resources, which are mostly coding methods and explanations of behavioral questions, we settled the Hangouts interview time. The Hangouts interview was relatively easy, though I misunderstood the desired deliverable. It seems that the reviewer expected me to come up with a fast-written solution rather than a though-through verified solution. This was weird for me, though I admittedly never asked if the reviewer wanted the code fast-written or well-thought through. This resulted in a reject. Overall, the interview process was pleasant, no serious time delays were artificially imposed, the answer came quickly. Interestingly, the HR manager was speaking Russian, so we discussed everything in my native language.

I was contacted by a recruiter who found my profile on LinkedIn. She asked me whether I was interested in a software engineering job at Google. It seemed like an interesting opportunity so I said yes. However, after the initial contact with this recruiter I kept on being passed on between different recruiters. I must have had contact with at least 4 different recruiters. When a date and time was finally set for the phone interview, I was stood up by one of these recruiters. I contacted him again, and a new time was set. Unbelievably, I was stood up again! The appointment was not in his agenda, he explained. Third time, I put the appointment in his agenda myself, and this time, the phone interview happened. We agreed on a date for the interview with an engineer. The recruiter said that he would send me information about what type of questions would be asked during the phone interview. He also said he would contact me again a little bit before the date of the interview. I never received any news anymore from the recruiter! A little while before the interview was supposed to happen I started working at another company. Given the previous experience I actually didn't expect them to call me. Surprisingly, they did! However, given how they treated me, and I was at my new job, I also stood them up. Afterwards, the recruiter emailed me again to ask me what happened. Maybe I should not have stood them up myself, but I feel they also acted very unprofessional during the recruitment process.

I received a phone call from a recruiter. We talked for roughly 45 minutes about my technical background and experiences, as well as the sorts of positions that are available currently in Software Engineering at Google. This was followed up one week later by a technical interview that consisted of two programming questions and almost no other discussion. I received my negative response from them a few hours later. I completed both questions with a little time to spare and without receiving help from the interviewer. The two shortcomings I saw in the interview that could have led to their decision not to move forwards were: 1. I briefly forgot the syntax for array declaration as it is not something I commonly use. 2. I decided to use a brute force iterative implementation rather than the more complex recursive solution to the problems. My advice to others would be to make sure you're 100% refreshed on the syntax of the language you will be interviewing in, and it may be worthwhile to attempt the riskier, flashy answer rather than the more basic solution.

I did the interview and had someone with a very heavy accent asking the questions which made things a bit difficult. I felt a bit flustered and it was very difficult being put on the spot and expected to solve the problem right then and there.

The recruiter called me and setup an initial phone interview. The interviewer called me and introduced himself. He was difficult to understand because of his heavy accent. Then he asked me a simple problem and asked me to immediately code it on the online whiteboard. The online whiteboard editor was really horrible and i struggled to type my code in. After I somehow finished typing(all the while not giving me a break to think about the problem but to keep typing and talking), he asked me its performance. Then i suggested the use of a different data structure to get better performance. Basically the interview was horrible and not what you expect from google. On top the problem was an easy one, which needed some time to think before coding(which was not encouraged). Not what you expect from the best company in the world.

Had a first phone interview where I was asked some questions pertaining to C and did some coding. The interviewer was slightly condescending but it was generally ok. A few weeks later I had another phone interview that started right off the bat with the interviewer asking me to write a function declaration in C++ without even an introduction from the interviewer. The interviewer also had an extremely thick accent and the connection was bad so I could barely hear what she was saying. When I asked her to repeat herself several times to make sure I understood what she was saying, she got very impatient and was extremely rude. For the last question, I was in the middle of optimizing my code when she abruptly specified that time was up and immediately hung up. It honestly seemed like she had given up on me midway through the interview after I had asked her to repeat herself a couple of times. After that it felt like she was barely paying attention to what I was saying. This was one of the worst phone interviews I've had.

The entire interview process took a long time. Over two months if I'm remembering correctly. That part wasn't so great. However, as stressful as an entire day full of interviews is, I actually really appreciate that now. My stress about technical interviews has always been that if they ask me about something I don't know, I come off looking like an idiot and that is their only impression of me. The 4+ interviews meant that even though I drastically flubbed one, that wasn't their only impression of me. Of course, I still didn't do well enough for Google, but I don't feel like I represented myself terribly because I was able to express different sides and answer a variety of questions.

I applied to Google and Facebook at roughly the same time. Although I did not get any offer, interview at Facebook was professional and friendly, and at the end I learned about my strong and weak sides. Interview at Google was the opposite of that. 1. Recruiter sent me an email asking when we could talk. I answered specifying when I have time for a phone call. Then there was over a week of silence, and finally recruiter called me on different hour that I specified. He said that he has one possible date for phone interview, so I accepted. 2. My first phone interview did not happen, because interviewer did not show up. Interview was rescheduled. 3. Second interview went smoothly. I answered all the questions, and interviewer seemed satisfied with the answers. 4. The same day recruiter called me and said that my evaluation was inconclusive and we need another phone interview. I asked for technical feedback, but I was not given any. The only information that I received was that "my solution was not good enough". 5. Second interview went similar to the first one. Again I answered all the questions. This time interviewer even said that he is satisfied with my answers. 6. After a week recruiter called me and said that evaluation was inconclusive again, and this ends recruitment process. I asked for technical feedback, and he said that he does not have any, but he will contact me when he get one. 7. After two weeks without information, I tried to contact my recruiter by email. Then again by phone. 8. After a month I received anonymous survey about my interview experience. I used it to complain about lack of information from recruiter and the fact that I still do not know why I was rejected. 9. The next morning I got a call from my recruiter. He apologized for not contacting me earlier and gave me technical feedback from my two interviews. I learned that first call I failed because my solution was not optimal (it was O(N log N) when O(N) was possible). On the second call I implemented optimal algorithm, but there were several issues with implementation that led to lowering my evaluation to "neutral". And two neutral opinions are not enough to qualify. Overall, recruiter never answered any of my emails, and each time we talk he was condescending and unfriendly. Overall it was frustrating and disheartening experience.

I had two back to back phone interviews. The first was harder due to communication issues. I couldn't understand the interviewer properly because of his accent. The second interview was fine. There were no questions I didn't expect, and the interviewer was helpful in answering my questions. I passed the interview stages and entered the matching stage very early on. However, I waited months for the first match and did not get picked for that project. Finally, I was denied the internship due to a lack of match. I would say that the interviews were not extremely hard. If you prepared then there should be no problem. The matching stage is really the issue. If you're lucky you get matched early on. If not you can wait for months and not get a match.

I interviewed with the Google LA office in Venice. Process was fairly quick. Recruiter contacted me by email and set up a technical phone interview. Phone interview was with a software engineer and it was a data structure/algorithm question (basic question was to remove duplicates from a list of strings). It was about 45 minutes. Engineer sounded friendly and asked me to optimize the solution. I thought it went well. After a couple of days, recruiter called me to setup an onsite interview. You know the drill. Google Onsite consists of 5 interviews - 4 coding interviews and 1 design interview and a lunch session (you will need it to recharge between coding sessions).  The onsite interviews were more difficult than the phone interview. My only tip if you really want a job at Google will be to practice data structure and algorithm questions... especially tress and graphs. 3 of my coding interviews were trees and graphs questions. The "Programming Interviews" book is pretty useful to brush up on these concepts and similar questions. I thought 3 of my interviews went well, the other two not so good. It all depends who you get to interview with also. One interviewer constantly interrupted me as i was writing code on the board, and repeatedly asking me to keep revising my solution. I ended up not having enough time to complete it.

The process for setting up the time/date and preparation for the interview was smooth. The recruiter was quick on emails and polite. After a brief chat over the phone with the recruiter I had a phone interview with the technical guy (an employee). The technical guy had a heavy Australian accent on top of speaking to me over a loudspeaker. I am used to American accent and understanding his speech required extra efforts of mine in addition to not hearing him properly because of his loudspeaker. I'd have asked him to switch to a "normal" microphone mode but being already very stressed I didn't think about that during the interview. I applied for a fresh grad position and this interview was one of the first interviews I had in my life. The guy asked me to write down an algorithm for a problem. But before that he spent about 20 minutes of basically bragging about himself. I know that it's normal for an interviewer to introduce himself and his projects but his talk was more than that! He gave a basic description of the problem and the trick was to ask more questions in order to come up with the properly working algorithm. The guy didn't make any efforts for giving me clues or trying to lead me through the solution. He was just like "Huh, ok, then what" or "Huh, ok". I felt he was waiting for the interview to be over asap. I'd have solved that problem but I was very nervous in part for being interviewed by Google, in part for not understanding properly what he was saying, and in part for his arrogance. I immediately sensed his arrogance after he asked me this question: "Have you worked with large systems?" To which I replied "Yes, the number of nodes ranged from X to Y" (which was already the max number for computing in my domain), and then he, with sensible ridicule in his intonation, said something like "Huh, this is not a big number." Everyone knows that Google has way way bigger numbers in their systems, but that doesn't mean that the interviewer has a right to belittle the experience of the candidates, nor to expect from a fresh grad to have worked on the Google-scale-like systems. I can't disclose the technical question asked during the interview, because you already know why.

I was contacted by a Google recruiter based on an internal referral from an ex-colleague. Since I already lived in the Bay Area and (apparently) my referrer did a great job talking me up, I was allowed to skip the phone screen stage and proceed directly to the on-site interviews. I went through 5 interviews (45 minutes each) on site, divided as follows: 3 on coding and algorithms, 1 on object-oriented design, and 1 on high-level system design. I also had lunch (1 hour) with an engineer, where I got to sample their famous free food and talk informally about life at Google. Like many other folks, I came in expecting very difficult and brain-warping questions. But to my pleasant surprise, none of the questions were particularly hard at all. The whiteboard coding and object-oriented design problems were really straightforward, very similar to the types of questions you'll get asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech firms. The system design question was a bit trickier, but it was ultimately just an open-ended discussion which felt pretty similar to real-life engineering design discussions that I do frequently at work. I definitely got the feeling that they don't care so much whether you "solve" the problem per se, but rather they focus more about how you analyze and approach the problem and how effectively you engage the interviewer in communicating your ideas. Personally, I really enjoyed all my interactions, and felt very engaged and energetic throughout the entire on-site interview day. After the on-site interviews, I received a call the next day from my recruiter, who told me that the feedback looked good and that I would be moved to the hiring committee stage. Within another three days, I was told the good news that I'd cleared the hiring committee (supposedly with flying colors, although perhaps the recruiter was just trying to flatter me!). They then checked my references and asked for details about my current compensation and competing offers. Finally, it took another week after that to do the team matching and receive the formal offer.

Can&#039;t disclose due to NDA. But as mentioned above, I did 3 coding interviews, 1 object-oriented design interview, and 1 high-level system design interview. The coding questions were of just average difficulty; I would say they are no harder than the types of questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech firms. Also, one of the coding interviews involved a few knowledge-based questions on Java (which I'd told my recruiter was my most familiar programming language--so they do seem to do some verification of your claimed expertise).   Answer Question

Cannot Disclose Interview Questions.   Answer Question

Was asked by one of Google's sourcerers' about potential interest. Checked which kind of position could be. Not much was said, other that we have a lot of flexibility in choosing what we want to do, location, and even title - what I was told was that everyone started as software engineering, no matter how long the career was; whether or not we came from research etc. Found this a bit strange, and not being too limited in terms of time, accepted to go over the first interview. First interview was done by an engineer, former (strong) background in research. Questions had nothing to do with my background though and so I asked to stop the process. Again spoke with the recruiter, and she tried a second person. Second interview was even worse. Somebody in SE, possibly experienced, who simply asked me to code a search algorithm on-the-fly. Made no sense to me as I am not in software engineering. There seems to be a strong disparity in terms of interviews, and background...I cannot believe that the questions are the same, and that it simply goes to coding, even if one does not intend to apply for software engineering.

There was a call for PhD internships somewhere in North America, I sent my resume and a recruiter contacted me. They wanted to do two phone interviews (2x45min), which took place approx. 3 weeks later. I requested Google Hangout with video, because someone suggested that to me as it would make the talking easier. About a week later I received an email that I passed the interview and that I will continue to the host matching phase. The first interviewer I had was very rude, he came too late and both his mic and earphones stopped working after a while. He didn't do anything to change it but just watched me code. It was difficult because I didn't know what to do exactly, but I solve the question nonetheless. Because of this we could only do one question, he asked nothing about my background and I could not ask him any questions. The second interviewer was very friendly. We chatted about my background, he asked a questions about OO programming and another one about list sorting. Both went well and in the end I got to ask him some questions as well.

There was a first interview, done through phone. It took about 30 minutes and covered solution to problems by use of textbook algorightms (e.g. how to get the largest 20 numbers of a huge list by using a heap). It was a time-boxed intervew (the interviewer made it clear in advance, and told how long it would take). The phone interview was followed by in-site interviews. Those took almost a whole day. A general interview with the recruiter explaining the whole interview process, followed by two technical interviews, then lunch, then two more interviews. Despite being made by different people, . Just a few interviewers asked to explain on a whiteboard, but all of them asked me to describe verbally everything I was thinking about the problem.

Had an initial call with a recruiter who then set up an initial phone screen. The phone screen went pretty well, but they wanted to schedule a second one just to make sure they wanted to move forward. The second was a little iffy since the question was very vague and general, and after that they decided not to continue.

The questions were what you expect of a standard programming interviews (DP, trees and other data structures). Make sure you have extensively reviewed algorithms before you attempt the interview.   Answer Question

Phone Screen consisting of basic algorithm questions, and a few questions about your background and if you clear it --a invitation onsite. Onsite consists of back-to-back algorithm rounds (4-6), with a lunch Break. Lunch is a good time to ask about working at Google. The process was very smooth and Google was very prompt in their responses.

I was contacted by a recruiter who set up a technical phone interview for me. The interview question was average in difficulty, I didn't cover a corner case and when I asked the interviewer to add code to cover a specific corner case, he said I was out of time. I didn't get to move on to a second interview. I feel my answer was good enough for screening purpose (you'd assume first phone interview is the screening interview). Anyway, I would say as humans, talking over the phone while coding, we might not be in the best state to cover all the cases especially if it's just the screening call.

During that initial phone screening we discussed my interest in the position, my current job, and established a deeper understanding of the role I was applying for. After we scheduled some time for phone technical interview. On the phone interview day I was contacted by an engineer. After some talk about my resume he gave me an algorithm question. We were on the Google Docs. I couldn't come up with a good solution. After a week I received an email saying they decided not to move forward with my candidacy.

Applied online and got back from a recruiter within an hour. Had a conversation with the recruiter a week after and he said I can go straight to the onsite for interviews. I was interviewing many other places parallel so I scheduled the onsite two weeks after the day I spoke with the recruiter but they don't seem to care how quickly you take the onsite so choose time to give yourself enough time to prepare. There were five onsite interviews with one lunch with a developer (I heard that the lunch is not an interview). I had to write solutions on whiteboard for all of questions so be prepared. I never heard of any of questions they asked but studying leetcode and interview books helped me figure out ways to solve algorithm questions. All of the interviewers were nice and the interview felt like I'm solving a real work problem with a coworker. Think about time complexity and efficiency at all time when you come up with a solution. It took less than 2 weeks to get an offer. Think this can be different for different people.

Contacted by recruiter after earlier narrowly failed interview. First stage was a short phone call with a few quick questions by the recruiter. This was followed by two 1-hour phone interviews with engineers; both of them consisted of one soft question and one programming problem. I wrote code in a Google Docs document that was shared between me and the interviewer. Before the interviews, the recruiter provided a wealth of preparation materials. The final stage was an onsite interview at a Google office. Google paid for travel and lodging, and was very flexible in scheduling the flight. There were four 1-hour interviews, each with a different programming problem and a few follow-up questions, with a lunch break in the middle. To write the code, I could use a whiteboard or a Chromebook that was provided. When I forgot a detail about a method of an STL container, I was allowed to pull up a reference page. There was a focus on doing things in an algorithmically efficient way; I was usually asked to estimate the complexity of my code, and come up with improvements if my initial solution was not optimal. Open source experience proved very useful, as I was able to provide in-depth answers to soft questions. After accepting the offer, there was a background check to verify my employment and education history, as well as my criminal record.

Every Googler I met was helpful, nice, and knowledgable. The interview problems were very challenging; be sure to practice, practice, and further prepare yourself to be able to design and implement algorithms to unique spins on classic CS problems. After the onsite interviews, the 4 interviewers submit their notes on you to a hiring committee. If you make it through them, your application is sent to a final committee to determine whether or not to make an offer. I was not made an offer but am preparing for the next round of interviews when I apply again next year. Google really seems like an amazing place to work.

It's really weird that the recruiter didn't send me a rejection email but instead emailed me to schedule a phone call to tell me the result! I heard that many recruiters from google told candidates bad results in this way. Maybe it's a way which google thinks could give candidates enough respect.

The process was extremely varied in terms of how long it took to hear back after each step. It ranged between 2 days and 2 weeks. I also got passed around between a lot of recruiters. After my onsite, I was asked to follow up with a second onsite, witch was supposedly so they could ask me questions they thought would be more suited toward my role. Then, it took a full week after that second on-site to finally get my rejection, which came by phone for some unknown reason. (Just reject people by email, it's easier for everyone!) I thought that the second round of on-site interviews actually went better than the first. This begs the question as to what exactly I could have done to get the offer on those second round of interviews. Why were they necessary? Google says they just look for good generalist programmers. This would seem to be called into question by this process. To sum it up, people are generally nice, but the process seems irrational and unnecessarily long. I can't help but feel like they willfully wasted a lot of my time.

I was referred by someone already working there full-time, and the first part of the process was a 45 minute phone screening. The interviewer had a pretty heavy accent and the phone connection was terrible, lots of static, so it was difficult to understand a lot of what he said, in hindsight I wish I had asked about using Google Hangouts. We were using Google docs so I was able to read his questions at least. There were no behavior questions, just 2 technical questions. After the 2nd question we were at 40 minutes and he said he had 1 question left but we didn't have enough time. I had the chance to ask my own questions for the last few minutes.

My interview was a 45 min call and ask me to developed some code in a Google Doc, the last minutes are if you have questions about the company. Prior to the interview you chose your language. The first question was a warm up. I did the second one a Linked List related but my interviewed didn't got my idea, he stopped me some times, after a small talk he let me continue/finish in the end he likes more my solution that what he was expecting. I started a third one but didn't have time to finish just wrote the some methods and some cod, I just explained the idea. I passed the first interviews and was disqualified in the second one.

Two phone interviews and four one on one interviews. The interview questions are not surprising but covers many topics in computer science. after interviewing with so many companies including Microsoft and Facebook etc. comparably the interviews at google are not pleasant nor comfortable. The interviewers are asked to write down whatever I write on the whiteboard. So most of the time they can't interact with me. Also two interviewers have communication problem. I mean, literally, communication problems in the eyes of software engineers. They couldn't talk and they just stared at the whiteboard listening. they then kept me waiting for a month for the result to come back. The HR told me two interviewers didn't fill in the results so no decision could e made. Really? You are soo busy that you couldn't fill in the results until 4 weeks late?

Submitted my application for Graduate role, received an email a few hours later to arrange an interview. I was very impressed with HR. The technical phone interview was done over a shared google doc, my interviewer had a heavy accent and I found it difficult to understand him. The initial question wasn't hard however being under the timed and watched conditions made it unnerving. I misunderstood a part of what the interviewer wanted so coded a different solution, once we established what he meant compared to my interpretation half the time was wasted, so make it very clear to them what you are planning on doing before you write anything. After this I think my interviewer lost interest and started asking generic "why do you want to work here" questions and it seemed that he wasn't listening anymore. So if you get asked those questions to waste time after you probably didn't do well. That being said, I know I didn't perform as I should have, so my rejection wasn't unexpected :)

I was contacted by a Google recruiter who found me via LinkedIn. I set up a call with him, and he scheduled a technical phone screen to take place in two weeks. He provided a bunch of information regarding Google and their interview process as well as some recommended ways to prepare. On the day of the phone screen, my interviewer called me on time. He asked me how I felt and then jumped into the first question. Unfortunately, he had a heavy accent and also had me on speakerphone, which made it somewhat difficult to understand him. On top of that, I focused too much on explaining my thought process line by line, which resulted in me taking way too long on the first question (which is supposed to be the easy one).

I was given enough time to prepare for the interview, I set the date of the interview to be after 2 months from the recruiter's phone call. The first phone screen interview was easy. I was asked some brief questions on my graduation project, then I was given a programming question. I passed the first interview and was asked to go for another phone screen before the onsite interview. The second interview was easy, probably easier than the first one, However, I screwed up big time. I still can't believe it went that way. I didn't pass, which was what I expected.

I was referred by an employee and had a short screening call with a recruiter to discuss the different locations and teams. After that, I was invited for an onsite visit where I met with 2 people for ~45 each. It was all technical about the expected topics for an SE (data structures, computational complexity, etc) with whiteboard coding. This went well enough, but I ended up withdrawing my candidacy for another opportunity. Fast forward a couple years, Google reached out to me and the timing was better. I was invited for another onsite (technically the 2nd in the process, I think my first still "counted") and met with 5-6 engineers for ~45 min each. Basically a longer version of the first visit.

The interview process was good and enjoyable, except for one interviewer who for some reason couldn't articulate what he wanted me to do. It took about 15 minutes to actually understand what he wanted.

Other than that I really enjoyed the experience.

I interviewed for a Software Engineering role at Youtube. First round very easy and it was possible to get through the question in 2 lines of code with a recursive approach. My interviewer then asked me to write the iterative version which I did. 2 weeks later my recruiter called me to tell me I made the final round. The final round consisted of 5 technical interviews. For me there were 4 coding and 1 system design. The coding questions covered purely data structures, algorithms. The system design question was also very technical too. I managed to get to an efficient clean solution on every single interview, tested my code and got good feedback from each one of my interviewers as well during the interview. Also I had great discussions with all my interviewers at the end of each interview, they were all very nice and helpful. However, the recruiter told me that they were not moving forward with me. I was very surprised. The recruiter mentioned I had received high scores on communication skills, analytical skills, and coding skills. The feedback was that I had some bugs in my code. I checked through every line I wrote at every interview and I don't believe this was actually true. I have never done so well at an interview just to get rejected and honestly I am sure I am not the only one google treats like this. I found the process to be very disrespectful to candidates as if we are robots. I personally lost all interest of working for the company.

All I can say is. WOW. Absolutely infuriating experience. LLOOONNNGG story short: I interviewed with Google NINE MONTHS ago today. The interview went well, I liked the people there. I was told I'd be getting an offer. For 9 months, on average I'd get a call every 2 weeks saying something to the effect of "we're sorry this is taking so long, you'll hear something no later than Friday". Eventually I got fed up with this and complained about the person telling me this that was consistently breaking his promises. After complaining, I got genuine phone calls of apology and then another "you'll hear from us within 2 weeks." 2 weeks passed. You can gather how the story goes on. I complained again. I felt that 9 months was unreasonable. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 20 times, shame on me. After my last complaint, I got a call from the recruiter telling me I'm no longer a candidate at Google. Absolute waste of time on both our parts. In the end no one won, which is what is so baffling to me.

The process began with a recruiter on LinkedIn contacting me after viewing my profile. The first phone screen was with the recruiter and seemed to be directed towards "placement" in the company. Questions involved things like "Do you like front end or back end coding more?", "What is the time complexity of QuickSort?", "How would you estimate some large exponential function?". There were 0 questions regarding experience or resume information. The second phone screen was with a technical interviewer within the company. The phone connection was awful, the speakerphone on Google's end increased the awfulness, the poor English of the interviewer increased the awfulness even more, and the lack of respect and attentiveness of the interviewer was the icing on the awful cake. The interviewer was not interested in any discussion of my experience or resume at all. He began by asking an esoteric math related programming problem. I frequently asked questions of the interviewer and was met with no response. At some point, I thought the phone dropped out because of 2 minutes of silence even after I asked multiple times if the interviewer was still there. Eventually, the interviewer said he had to leave to use the bathroom while I was struggling and asking questions. He didn't return for 15 minutes. After my time was up, the interviewer said "OK, time is up, good bye" and hung up on me. This isn't how a company as large as Google should be conducting interviews. After notifying the recruiter of the poor interview, she set me up with a third phone screen. The third phone screen had a much more attentive and polite interviewer. Again, no questions regarding experience or resume information were asked. We began immediately by working in a Google Docs window about solving a path finding problem. Google Docs is really bad with code formatting and syntax highlighting, so it was a bit of a nightmare to type out a solution. I left this interview feeling a little better. The final part of the process was to schedule onsite interviews in Mountain View, CA. I was bounced between 2-3 different recruiters and a third party travel agency, so coordinating the travel was frustrating. I'm surprised my application wasn't lost during all the transfers. The onsite process was similar to other tech companies in the sense that there was a long, full day of interviews. In total, there were 6 interviews across a 7 hour period with a lunch interview shoved in there somewhere. Many of the interviewers seemed to be bored or not interested in conducting interviews, so it was a similar experience as my second phone screen. I get the feeling that Google forces their engineers to perform interviews but doesn't hold them accountable to the quality of their interview process. In addition, many interviewers spoke poor English and couldn't successfully communicate the problem that I was required to solve. And finally, I was never asked experience or resume related questions. Google simply doesn't seem to care about experience. In the end, I was contacted with the standard "We are not moving forward with your application" with no feedback that would allow me to improve.

I was contacted by a recruiter who told me the hiring manager liked my resume. She then setup a technical phone interview. For that interview, I was contacted an hour ahead of the scheduled time. I asked my interviewer if he could give me 5 minutes to get ready, but he said it was alright and would call me an hour later. He called and mentioned his name and that he was from Google. Then he copy-pasted a problem into Google Docs and asked for a solution. So yes, no introductions about himself or about me. I guess they don't care until you go onsite as a "potential" candidate. I asked a couple of questions to make sure I understood the problem. Afterwards, I wrote a recursive DFS solution. The interviewer said my solution was fine and that he had no more problems for me. I asked him some questions about the job role, but all I got was vague/cryptic answers. Very weird? Overall, the experience is negative/neutral. My recruiter was AWESOME! (Keep in mind that Google recruiters are different from those who schedule your interview.) Very nice and well spoken. She also articulated to the best of her abilities the role I was applying for without getting into a lot of the details because of confidentiality. Unfortunately, my phone interviewer was a dud. I guess interviewing with Google matters much about the coding skills you have as well as the luck of the draw on who interviews you. Good Luck!

Applied online and got a response in a week with a request of online coding problem, which can be solved in 20 mins. I passed it and got a phone interview within that month. This is also not that difficult, but just went through some basic concepts such as OOP design and concepts. The coding question is straightforward as well, as long as you know how to deal with IO, strings and basic programming. Then I got a phone call from recruiter the other day, and I was told the phone interview went well and the next step is onsite. Onsite interview is cool. 4 rounds, and every round was interesting. We talked much about OOP design and explored the potential issues that may occur if I chose a bad design. The programming problems was not that difficult if you have practiced with enough coding interview problems. I did a bad job in the last round, where I was asked to implement functions of a self-designed data structure. I was kind of tired and did not understand the functionality until I coded it through, and of course I made several mistakes that made my interviewer believed I "catch" things slowly. After 2 weeks, I got a notice phone call that telling me I was rejected, with a slice disadvantage.

Coding puzzle to test if you really know your favorite language and can use it to solve puzzles. They made me write code that compiles, and work through "compiler" errors until it was valid.   Answer Question Basic coding problem to test data structures and algorithms knowledge. Think recursion, heaps, binary search trees, that kind of stuff.   Answer Question System design problem, no coding involved. I had to design a large, complex system that I never could have done by myself. I just started designing what I could and the interviewer asked questions to guide and inform the design. By the end I think I seemed like a genius but I knew the interviewer was the one who knew the proper design, not me.   Answer Question Very vague coding task, I was given a function signature and spent the next 5 minutes teasing out potential solutions and discussing pro's and con's of each one. Eventually arrived at a multithreaded solution which they then wanted me to implement on the whiteboard. I did not need to know any specific threading API, because they let me use any libraries I wanted, even if they don't exist, just as long as they make sense. This question tested my knowledge of multithreading concepts thoroughly, so this is definitely something you should review!   Answer Question A very difficult-seeming coding problem. It's the type of problem that makes you crap yourself at first but if you keep a level head you can hopefully spot an elegant way to solve it. There is an obvious solution but it is very painful and inefficient to implement, and there is a more subtle solution using dynamic programming that is the most efficient and easiest to implement. They will know you're a rock star when you solve the problem elegantly using the proper CS concept.   Answer Question

This is the experience of someone who lives 2000 miles away from Google's Mountain View campus. I applied online and heard back in less than a week. The HR phone interview went well so I got a technical phone interview. They gave me a study sheet that lists everything you might need to know for the technical portion of the interview, which is loads of computer science theory, algorithms and data structures and such. I highly suggest studying this! It is the kind of stuff that you don't normally know offhand but you can brush up on it pretty easily if you knew it at one point. If you have to learn these things fresh then you've got to do it, but I don't think you'll be successful in the interview because it's got to come like second nature. I had plenty of time between the HR phone interview and the technical phone interview, so I spent that time diligently reviewing the things I should know. They are not out to trick you, they sincerely want you to be well prepared for the interview because even great candidates fail simply because they didn't take the time to prepare. The phone interview went well and I felt the interviewer really took time to read my resume and ask thoughtful questions. The questions were not too difficult, and they even gave me 5 minutes to talk about a job that interested them on my resume which was non-technical in nature. If you know how to code and solve simple puzzles you should do fine. I even made some technical mistakes like not being able to find the most efficient solution and I struggled through a question about a hypothetical project management scenario (that question came out of left field, and I stammered and stumbled through the last few minutes giving my answer). 3 weeks later they flew me out for 2 nights to the on-site interview. I should mention it wasn't a "normal" on-site interview, because apparently it was some kind of major hiring event called a "batch day". In terms of the interview itself it was the same as they always do, but what was abnormal was the sheer number of people they had on-site for interviews. I never found out how many there were, but in my building alone there were close to 20 that I saw, and there were loads more candidates walking around campus during lunch time. The on-site consisted of 5 separate 45 minute interviews, each with a different interviewer. I say it was difficult because the questions cover advanced technical subject matter that will be difficult to the majority of engineers. However, if you're the superstar they're looking for the questions will not be that difficult, and may even be fun to solve. I think it's safe to say that if you think any of the questions are difficult and/or you spend the whole 45 minutes writing your solution then you're probably answering the wrong way. They like to test if you know a CS concept by asking generic questions and seeing if you identify the proper data structures or algorithms to use. For example, if your algorithm is wasting time (and whiteboard space) to keep a collection sorted, it could be because you didn't recognize that the full ordering doesn't matter and you should be using a priority queue instead. Those kinds of identifications are major things they're looking for. A week after the on-site I found out the hiring committee approved me. That's when they called my references and a couple weeks later I spoke with various engineering managers who were interested in my skills and background. They didn't care that I had no experience doing what they do, because they knew I was a skilled coder from the interview notes and I'm smart enough to figure it out on the fly. This part is not an interview, just a conversation about interests. They want to find out if you're going to enjoy working on their project, not if you're smart enough or have the right experience - they already vetted that in the on-site interview. In my case I talked with 3 managers who all had different and interesting work, which made it difficult to decide, but ultimately I got to choose which project to join because they all were a great fit. A week after being placed with a team, they wrote up my offer and put it to the VP and senior VP reviews. The waiting is the most stressful thing, because at this point there's practically no reason they're going to reject you, but you have to wait so long for the offer to finally come. Be patient, there is light at the end of the tunnel! After the offer was reviewed by the top execs I got it by e-mail, set my start date and digitally signed it. Now a relocation team is helping me move across the country to start in a month and a half!

Applied online, contacted by a recruiter who set up three back-to-back phone interviews. I basically answered every single question. Needed a slight push a couple of times, but a slight push was always sufficient. Then a couple of days later I received a devastating rejected letter. Is it possible that it's just too late in the recruiting process so they don't have many interview positions left, or did I simply not do as well in the interviews as I thought?

The process started by sending a resumé and a cover letter for a posted software engineer developer. After around two weeks, I got an email from a recruiter to setup a first interview on hangouts. This was more about information regarding the upcoming process of tests over the phone and the onsite ones. We decided on a time for the first phone coding test using a shared google doc to show the progress of solving two coding tasks.

I was contacted through e-mail by a Google recruiter who found me in their system since I've interviewed with them three years ago. The recruiter scheduled for a 15 minutes screening phone call to talk about job description but was late by half an hour. While on the call, there were a lot of background noise so I couldn't understand what the recruiter was asking / saying. It seemed odd to me that a massive company like Google could not have their recruiters handle calls in a quiet environment. We agreed that we would continue the interview process and scheduled an 1:1 technical interview for 3 weeks later. The recruiter was helpful in providing a lot of useful information regarding how I could prepare for the interview. During the interview, it was a bit awkward since the interviewer asked me to answer his questions verbally and type out the answers at the same time. The opinion and behaviour questions were limited to 1~2 minutes each. He also was very insistent on asking kernel related questions, even though it wasn't part of the job description and I told him I had no experience in it. At the end, the interviewer gave a coding question that I was to complete in 15 minutes. It was hard to understand the interviewer due to his accent, and the question was very vague. However, after spending 10 minutes asking clarifications, the question turned out to be relatively reasonable but I didn't have enough time to finish it. My recommendation would be for the candidate to be very familiar with data structures and algorithms.

Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. I wasn't ready to move ahead at that point of time. I followed up later when I had an offer with another firm and the recruiter was ready to have me onsite directly ( with a referral ). The onsite round was 5 coding interviews on the white board including a lunch as well. The interviewers were well prepared and friendly. Each interviewer was in sync with the questions to be asked as per the process. I won'd disclose the questions asked due to NDA. However, all the questions were based on problem solving/ algorithms/ graphs. Google is one of the few places to have a very fair interview process without asking questions out of scope or questions that required the interviewee to have prior knowledge. Most of the questions were based upon fundamentals of problem solving and required coding on the white board.

The process was very long and stressful. This was my second time interviewing at Google. After an phone screening, I was invited to the office for an onsite interview. My interviews happened to be split-up between two visits. I had three interview on my first visit and three more on my second. The interviews were fairly relaxed and I managed to find solutions to each interview question, but was still denied an offer. Given my performance during the interviews, the recruiter was willing to work with me on finding a team at Google that might be a good fit for me, and then try to appeal to the Hiring Committee once more. Speaking with teams combined with long wait times for feedback resulted in a 4 and half month long interviewing process. In the end, I wasn't given an offer. Appreciate Google effort in trying to find a place for me, but the process was draining and raised my hopes several times only for me to leave with nothing in the end. I don't see myself interviewing for Google again, unless I had better assurance for faster feedback.

My Interview process was composed of an initial phone interview, 5 or 6 face-to-face interviews (for which I was flown to the Pittsburgh office) and a couple of extra phone interviews. These last two by phone were due to a confusion on their side: they needed to assert my knowledge of Java but all interview responses ended up being done in Python. It took about 2.5 months from application to final offer. Questions are all technical and not easy. The interviewer is there to help you and you need to talk to him even to fully understand the question being asked. Talk through your logic process, he needs to understand it and can better assist you in case you are going the wrong route. Unless you are really smart and very knowledgeable of CS (algorithms, data structures, analysis etc), you need to study, train and prepare. Online courses, interview preparation books and Wikipedia are very good reference material. They ask for previous colleagues/managers for referrals and do call them.

I applied online, and a recruiter got back to me very promptly. There were two rounds of phone interviews and one hectic day of on-site interviews (I interviewed on site with three other companies, but this was by far the most gruelling experience) at their headquarters in Mountain View. There were five interviews (excluding the lunch) in the on-site process: four algorithmic/coding interviews, and one interview about my research interests. After interviewer feedback, my packet went to the hiring committee and was finally approved by the executive management committee. All told, the process took just under three months. While Google has a very simple, smooth and responsive application process that belies their current size, the interview process itself shows just how big the company has become. While the recruiter was very prompt in reaching out to me in the beginning, they were pretty slack in responding to my further follow-ups. In fact, I'm certain that I got done in less than three months only because I had a couple of counter-offers, and otherwise I could have gone through this process for a few more months. On top of this, there was absolutely no one from recruiting or HR to show me around the campus or to walk me to the exit after the end of the day during my on-site visit. As a result, the experience felt slightly impersonal.

I signed an NDA, so cannot disclose the exact questions. Prepare your algorithms and data structures questions well, and actually implement them. Websites like careercup and leetcode are valuable resources to prepare. Focus on binary trees, hash tables and dynamic programming questions. Lastly, don't be afraid to go with your gut, sometimes you may end up implementing a solution that might be better than what your interviewer had in mind!   Answer Question

I applied online and got a phone call exactly one week later. I was given a long list of resources to review and told there although they are looking for a Front End Engineer- they don't have an interview process for front-end but only for generalist computer science. Also, they can't guarantee a front-end position although they will try their best. So I should start reviewing data structures, algorithms, discrete mathematics, system design, and more...! I was given 2-3 weeks to review the material and let them know when I am ready to interview. In later conversations I was told if I pass the screening I would be given a front-end angled interview. But that never happened since I was rejected after only the screening stage.

Although I didn't formally sign an NDA I did agree to not talk about details on blogs or forums. That said I can only discuss in general terms. The questions were really not what I was expecting. There were two questions and neither of them required data structures or even an algorithm. Really just a standard coding question requiring some logic, analysis, and OO design but nothing fancy. Alas, for reasons beyond me the interviewer did not like how I answered the questions. Google does not provide any feedback on why you were rejected beyond a standard copy/paste response from the recruiter. On a side note- the interviewer didn't ask a single question about me or seem to care in the slightest. "Just another day, another interview" kind-of attitude. Which I guess is to be expected from them, but kinda depressing from the interviewee perspective. Afterwards I went through the interview minute-by-minute in my head and tried to guess what the interviewer was looking to see. Obviously it's a lot easier to come up with a great design when you are not under pressure. So no pearls of wisdom from me how I would do it differently since I felt I was very well prepared. I guess it's partially the luck of the draw, and the mood of the person doing the screening. When they have the full day of interview at least there needs to be a consensus from several interviewers. In the screening stage you get only one chance and one persons opinion to get you through the door.   Answer Question

The interview involved three 45-minute back-to-back technical phone interviews. They asked me to solve and implement the solution to some basic algorithmic problems, of the type that you would encounter in Top Coder or similar platforms. The questions weren't though but they required technical maturity and confidence with this kind of problems. You get to choose your preferred programming language. However, one of the interviewers assumed that I was going to use Java, while I had decided to use Python. So I would suggest to have one preferred and one backup language, and the backup language should be either Java or C++. During each interview you may get to solve more than one problem, sometimes incrementally (building on solutions to previous problems), sometimes brand new problems. After having taken this interviews I feel like spending some time on Top Coder and getting acquainted with those problems is worth the time.

I was contacted by a recruiter after taking second in a hackathon. I wasn't really planning on switching jobs, but I figured "hey, it's *Google*", so I accepted the invitation for an interview. When I interviewed, I was finishing my last year of university two hours away, and working full time for a startup, so I didn't give studying for the interview the attention it deserved. The recruiter set me up a call with someone who had some overlapping knowledge. The interview itself was standard coding in a Google Doc of some algorithms. I tried to follow the suggestions in Cracking the Coding Interview, but ended up doing worse trying to over analyze the situation. The phone call quality was absolutely terrible. You'd really think Google would prefer a Hangout where you can actually hear what the interviewer is saying. It sounded like the guy put me on a speakerphone wrapped in saran wrap at the bottom of a fish tank... I had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times, making me feel silly. I learned later that apparently they do this type of thing on purpose to see how you handle extra stressful phone situations. Questions were standard algorithm questions.

I then went into detail about how DNS works and the various types of records and how the whole system has a hierarchy, zone transfers etc. At the end the interviewer asks "What really happens?" &lt;sigh&gt; Many times your interviewer will have very poor English skills and you will have to constantly ask them to repeat their questions - which does not look good for you.

The most long and drawn out bureaucratic process. There are multiple phone interviews. The first starts with someone from HR who will ask you basic CS and systems type questions. They have no idea what the answers are but this is the process. There are then a number of other phone interviews (3 at least) before you are asked to come onsite. They will drag it out for months for some reason. Maybe it's to see if you really want to work there, maybe it's company hiring incompetence, who knows. It's a nice place to use for interview practice if you are just starting out interviewing after working for many years.

A phone interview followed by a full-day onsite technical interview. During the onsite, I interviewed with two engineers from the general Google employee pool and three from the group I would be working with. The questions focused on algorithm development and whiteboard coding exercises, object-oriented design methodology and practice, and one interview with specific questions on dynamic systems which was relevant to the position for which I was interviewing. I also had a one-on-one lunch that was not technical but I suspect was a behavioral interview.

It was a positive experience overall but during one interview I felt like the interviewer was trying to solve the problem in his head as I was solving it on the board and his hints sort of misguided me. In either case I liked the process, got an offer and accepted it, despite a few blunders and missed edge cases.

I prepared by reading many parts of Skienna’s algorithm design manual, and watching MIT algorithm lectures. I was already good at algorithms considering my previous class performances so I was just brushing up my knowledge. I spent particular attention to Graph theory following the advice of steve-yegge Blog post on the same topic. Solved as many algorithm problems as I could (I would say I spent a total of 30 hours preparing before my interview over one month), especially graphs because I figured graphs were important at google and if I could dazzle them with my ability to do graph problems then I was in. The day started gray to begin with and went downhill from there. The recruiter got there 15 minutes later than our meeting time and meanwhile I went from being mildly nervous to almost hysteric. When we met the first interviewer who was visibly annoyed because of the delay (or maybe that was just my perception), the recruiter blamed me for being late. That’s right. I was so shocked, it took me some seconds to actually figure out he really was saying this and after that I didn’t know what to do to make it right (pathetic, I know). I had five interviews back to back and one additional lunch interview in between. During my first interview it was as if I had a block in place of my brain, I must have asked the poor engineer 10 times to explain the question to me. It was as if he was talking gibberish. I could not focus, I was too nervous and pissed off at the recruiter. Needless to say, I could not write even one single line of code, mainly I stared at the whiteboard. I still don’t remember what the question was actually. I was so embarrassed. No algorithm question was ever asked. Yes, you heard it right. Not even something involving binary tree or search; nothing. There was one design question and three coding question. In short, there were things that were under my control. I didn’t do any whiteboard coding (big mistake) and didn’t have time for mock up interviews (another big mistakes). Given all that happened at the beginning to unhinged me (I am skipping something else that happened on the morning of the interview), had I practiced solving questions on the whiteboard and had I done mock up interviews I should have been able to handle it beautifully. The engineers who did the interviews, were all so nice and smart. The recruiters, oh well.

I first had a phone screen interview. After this, I was asked to come onsite for further interviews. I had 4 whiteboard and 1 lunch interview with the Youtube team. After this, I was told that my application is going through the Hiring Committee. Hiring committee asked my HR to find a team for me before giving any decision. I then had two phone interviews with different teams in Android. I informed my HR that I am interested in the first team. Next day, HR emailed me and said that this team no longer has an open position. I again went through the same process. This time, platform team was interested in talking to me. I gave 2 phone interviews wherein they made me write code. After their feedback, I was put through the Hiring committee again and this time I got a thumbs up from them. 1 week after that I was put through executive committee and got my offer. I had 7 other offers and my HR asked me about all of them before putting me through executive review. They gave me more than any other company I had offer from.

Did I take Computer Architecture in college   1 Answer

Feb 25, 2015

A recruiter reached out to me and set up a technical phone screening. That screening went well, and I got a second phone screening. For the second one, however, I couldn't understand my interviewer's accent. I tried asking him to repeat himself many times, but it didn't help. In the end, I did badly because I simply had no idea what he was asking of me. There were times that I wasn't even sure if he was talking about the code he wanted me to write or about my resume. Additionally, he asked me for qualifications that, if he'd read my resume, it would have been clear that was not my area of expertise. I'm mostly qualified for OO-programming at a high level, and he was asking me about computer architecture. I emailed my recruiter right after the second interview telling her my situation (politely, of course), but a week later, she called to tell me they rejected me. When I asked if she'd gotten my email, she seemed confused, and I'm not entirely sure she paid it much mind. I'm not saying I deserved to get the job, but I certainly didn't deserve to be ruled out because I couldn't understand my interviewer's accent.

Flew me into NYC for interview. Quick meeting with HR & then five (or was it six?) 45 minute white board sessions with engineers with a lunch break with another one. I'm terrible at those things--in fact, I'd never done anything like it except for meetings on systems design--brain froze up in the middle of the first one and I never really recovered. If you're an older developer, the process can be quite alienating. First off, I'm not sure if you summed the ages of any of the two people I met up, it would equal mine. The guy they sent me to lunch with (my turn to ask questions, learn about the culture) was younger than my son! He was a great guy, but perhaps some senior person in HR with grown kids should try this sometime. Second, the brain-teaser at the whiteboard approach just wasn't the way we learned to tackle problems (I started coding in the early eighties). There are already enough criticisms of this hiring strategy, the irrelevance of these kinds of questions to the real requirements of getting systems running in production, and the "brogrammer" culture it fosters elsewhere, so I won't go into it. Criticism notwithstanding, you can't argue with their success. Only once all day was I asked to talk about something I had accomplished. Everybody I met was likable and nice. Much to their credit, the interviewers were understanding of the brain-freeze-at-whiteboard problem and I never got a smart-alecky smirk in five hours. The lunchroom was outrageous, and I would have stuffed myself if I hadn't three interviews left. This interview model is endemic in the industry. If you are over fifty, good luck out there.

The Google engineer with unique accent called me. He asked some brief question regarding my resume, and he started the coding problem. I was screwed up, and he tried to give some sub-problem that could be a hint for the coding assignment after 30 minutes has elapsed. After 40 minutes elapsed, he explained the brief solution. He and I also used Google Docs to show my code. It was somewhat hard to communicate with the interview because of his somewhat unique accent. After several days, I got some notice that I would not be considered for next interview.

I was referenced by my friend. Recruiter contacted me, and we assigned first phone interview. Interviewer was very nice. He gave hints and just pointed to lines where I was mistaken, after that I found mistakes myslef and fixed it. After that they invited me to onsite interview to Warsaw. My mistake was to prepare on codeforces, topcoder and solved hard ACM problems, that was unnecessary. I did not prepare by easy and tricky interview questions. That's why I failed 2 out of 4 interviews and did not get offer.

Phone interview question: You have a collection of arrays with length 10. Every 2 elements represent a domino(0,1; 2, 3; 3,4,...i and i + 1 one domino). Write a function that gets an array as parameter(with length 10) and returns true if given array exists in your collection, false otherwise. You are free to use any data structure to store arrays(For example I used HashSet of arrays).   1 Answer

I first met with a recruiter on campus, the recruiter instructed me to apply online to be considered for the position. Got an invite for an interview a few days after I submitted my application. Interviewed in October 2014. The interview was two back-to-back 45 minute interview. Lots of technical questions as you'd expect from Google.

First a phone call with a recruiter. They go over the job, why you'd love it, and talk to you about your experience and what you're interested in. If they see it's a fit, they set you up with an engineer for a phone screen. The technical phone screen is done online using a Google Doc. You'll be asked a fairly basic coding question or two, and you'll code it out in the Google Doc where the engineer can see it. If you pass this round, you move on to the on site interview. On site interviews consist of five separate 45 minute interviews with an engineer. They keep a card with the topics they've covered and how deeply, otherwise, they don't communicate with the previous interviews. This is a great system, because it prevents your interviewers from having preconceptions - if you bomb one interview, that's no problem, just do well in the next one. Expect hard algorithmic computer science questions. They will be very heavily based around data structures, some sort of text parsing or searching, and algorithm performance. Study up on things you might not use every day like tries, graphs, as well as more basic things like binary trees and hash tables. Be able to recognize the Big-O performance of an algorithm you've written, and know how to improve it. Interviewers are generally very helpful. They want you to get it right. They'll drop hints, help you get through parts where you're stuck. But you are expected to get it in the end - if you haven't come up with a working, high performance solution to the problem by the end of the 45 minutes, you'll probably fail that leg.

Signed NDA, can't reveal my questions. Study data structures, study text parsing, text searching, pretty much anything text related. It might seem like an overload on one topic, but remember...they are a search company at heart.   Answer Question

Two round phone interview, the second one is kind of wired, I cannot hear the engineer clearly and he had heavy accent. Also he called very late, much later than the scheduling time. The two questions were not about data structure or algorithms. If you know the answer, you get it, if not, you are screwed (basically means there is no progress to the solution). I spend 30 minutes understand the first question, I told him to clarify again and again but he just told me that is all you have. I didn't know what should I do or what should I write. So after 30 minutes we skipped the first question. Overall the interviewer is not very good at English and remain silent most of time during interview, not so helpful.

Implement a function using two existing functions, but in the end I still didn't know what I know about these functions and what should I add. Second one is more like brain teaser.

The process went on for about 50 days or so. After the initial call from the recruiter, i got around 15 days to prepare for the first round, aka the screening. This was conducted over a phone call and lasted for a little more than an hour. Basic questions, nothing too hard, the key was to demonstrate the thought behind the solution and find if multiple solutions exist and not just the end result. 4 days later, i got a call from the recruiter who informed me that i have been shortlisted for an onsite interview at the Google office. I got around 20 days this time around to prepare. Had 4 rounds of interviews at the office, mostly on data structures and their usage. The key thing again was to demonstrate your ability to arrive at a solution, rather than directly solve it. I do not think the questions were very difficult, but in some sense my nervousness got the better of me and even though i had solved a lot of similar questions during my preparation, i jumped to conclusions on the answer and delivered incomplete answers. Overall, my experience with the entire hiring process right from the time of the first call till the end was very good. I am happy that i got the opportunity to review algorithms and solve many problems during the preparations. It is sad that i did not get through, but i look forward to applying again to Google. As for the interactions with the employees at Google, they were very helpful during the interviews or otherwise.

Recruiters moved quickly. People usually say that they are the bottleneck but they scheduled the phone screen within a week. First off, the call quality was really bad. I stated that a few times so maybe we can switch to a landline or something but was ignored (maybe he didn't hear me). First round was basically a programming quiz for which the interviewer was not very prepared. I mean there is a difference between a mediocre response and a great response but if it doesn't match the expected response (which in that particular case was a common misconception) you can get laughed at (like I did). Sometimes I still re-read the technical papers just to reinforce my belief I shouldn't have been laughed at for that answer. This totally bummed me out and it all went straight downhill from there. Then the coding began and I wrote the solution. It was welcomed with a heavy sigh + 'make it better'. I pitched a lot of ideas from my algorithm 'toolset' that solved the problem but now within some constraints that were added on the fly when the ideas were shut down. I didn't get the 'a-ha' for the optimal solution with no hints (I was close at some point - saw the solution on geeksforgeeks later in the day) so the interviewer told me he had to be someplace and If I had any questions for him and that was that.

Contacted by a recruiter after a former co-worker from another company that is now in Google recommended me. First screening interview was on site since I live close to Google's offices in Tel-Aviv. Small algorithm/data-structure question with coding in C++ and a bit of STL. The interviewer was not very nice, snobish and condescending, yet I passed without any issues and was invited to a full on-site interviews day at a later date. The on-site interviews included 3 interviews focusing on algorithm/data-structures including a bit of coding. Nothing very difficult, but requiring good knowledge of topics like trees/lists traversal, dynamic programming, binary search, etc. One interview was on C++ knowledge, basic stuff like virtual functions, multiple inheritance, etc. with a small algorithm and coding question. Last interview was a design interview - design an image sharing system in which users can upload images, then get a short URL unique for their image and use it in forum messages, social networks posts, emails, etc. I was told by the recruiter that the feedback was mixed but with enough support for passing to the hiring committee. Then I was rejected and told by recruiter that the design interview is the cause. I find this decision very wrong, considering what I accomplished in my career and am sure 100% that any former colleague of mine would testify very positively on my design skills, but think back on the design interview I'm not surprised: The interviewer gave me a pen and papers so I could draw and write my design, but as soon as he finished asking the question he picked a pen and paper and started solving it himself, he seemed to be in a hurry to reach exactly the solution that he expects. He was not nice, arrogant and unpleasant to talk to and have an open discussion. In total 3 of the 6 interviewers were not people I would like to work with, while the other 3 were very nice and were fun to talk to and think together. I wasn't asked even once on my work experience or any of my past projects, no single "behavior" question like "describe a scenario in which you had a conflict", etc. and wasn't asked why I would like to join Google or what I'm looking for in a work place. It seems the entire process revolves around solving technical questions and nothing beyond that, so it's not surprising to me that 3 of 6 interviewers (in my opinion of course) had such bad people skills. I constantly had the feeling that the interviewers (all of them) prefer meek and inexperienced candidates, that can be shaped and trained to think exactly like them and would not show independent or out-of-the-box thinking. *** It actually felt to me like my experience and knowledge is an obstacle or a disadvantage instead of an asset that the company would and should appreciate !!! *** Other than that - I enjoyed solving the questions, food was great (and the engineer that escorted me was very nice and friendly, we had interesting discussions), the offices look and feel great. The recruiter was super friendly, always kept me informed and did his best to speed up the process, I have only good words to say about him. I later passed successfully interviews in other companies (including Google's competitors), some of which were more difficult, and received excellent offers from great work places, and I definitely think the process in Google leads to bad decisions. I was offered by the recruiter to try again in 12 months, but I have no such intention, nor would I recommend it to talented people that I know.

The people were all pretty nice - I enjoyed talking with both my recruiters (the first recruiter, who did recruiting for multiple offices, and the second recruiter, who dealt only with the Washington area) although the salary negotiations were pretty annoying - be prepared to deal with tactics meant to push your salary lower than you would want otherwise (although the offer was pretty damn reasonable to begin with, so I can't complain). I'm not sharing any questions from the interview process here, as per the frequently mentioned NDA, suffice to say that you will receive ample information on what you need to prepare ahead of time. See other reviews for what your interview will look like - they're all pretty much on the ball. After the interview, you're run past a hiring committee, then submitted to VPs for approval, then salary negotiations, followed by the final offer.

(from the phone screen) given a set of inputs, sort them such that the proceeding digit alternates higher, then lower than the preceding digit (i.e. 1, 5, 2, 8, 5, 10, 1, 6, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 10)   Answer Question

I was recruited for a specific position, but told that I had to pass the general technical interview before I could be considered. The recruiter was very accessible and worked with my schedule to set up everything. There was no rush at all. The interview itself was ok - I felt like the people who were assigned to evaluate my PhD research project had no background at all while the guy assigned to my technical interview would have been much more appropriate (and he had trouble following my solution in the technical interview).

NDA applies here - Cracking the Coding Interview is a very good indication of what you will encounter, though. Focus on coding quickly and understanding seemingly simple questions inside out.   Answer Question

Submitted application online. I was contacted by a recruiter. I had a phone-screen interview and then invited for an on-site interview. It was a nice experience overall. It can be an exhausting experience, but exciting and interesting! I was asked questions that required searching a solution recursively. One of them was related to palindromes. One was reading code (.h files) and telling what it did and how to use it. They covered all expenses and the hotel they choose was the nicest hotel I've ever been (by far). Most of the people was nice and helpful. One of the interviewers was sick and eating bread during the interview, making noises and was kind of distracting.

Five min introduction "tell me about your PhD/project". Then, a probelm was given me to solve in very vaguous way. I clarified, proposed datastructures and custom datastructures I will use to solve the problem. I was coding, speaking aloud, my interviewr was silent. "Are you happy now with your code?", no I wasnt since I did not debugged it yet. "Are you happy now with your code?", no, let me double check... "Are you happy now with your code?", "Are you happy now with your code?", yes now I am happy, "OK". Then he asked me about complexity and If i can do better than this.

I was referenced by a friend, right after that the recruiter contacted me, asked some general questions and assigned a phone interview date. On the phone interview I was given some really easy algorithmic questions. I had no trouble answering them. Later on the same day the recruiter contacted me again, said that I passed the phone interview and invited me for an on-sight interview to Zürich. Google provided me with flights and accommodation. On the on-sight I had five interviews and one "lunch with a developer", actually with my friend. First four interviews were general algorithmic ones and the last one was about system design. On the first and second interviews I didn't do well, I needed too many hints from the interviewers, but I managed to solve the problems anyway. The last three interviews went much better, I solved the problems correctly and fast without hints. Ten days after the on-sight I got the refusal. They told I have the potential, but have to practice more. I don't know why other people write here that Google is disorganized and unfriendly. I found it organized very well and extremely friendly. The interviewers were very nice, Google looks like a perfect workplace. As for questions: there are no questions like "implement heap" or "how does quicksort work". Instead they give you algorithmic or math problems (I had no math, but my friend had mostly math). You must know complexities, the big-O notation. Also the interviewers always ask "how would you test it" after you write the solution, so prepare to answer that. Read "Cracking the coding interview", it describes the process and questions just fine.

I applied to the general new graduate Software Engineer position online via the jobs website. I was asked to take an online coding assessment that was timed to 60 minutes. It was unscheduled, and they requested I complete it within 6 days. A recruiter got in touch about 1.5 weeks later to schedule a phone interview. The recruiter asked about my GPA, who I knew at Google (for a reference), and my transcripts. They also asked normal questions about my other interviews or deadlines, visa sponsorship, etc. The phone interview was about 35-45 minutes long. The interviewer called me late and did not introduce themselves, they just jumped immediately into the first question. They also asked me to type my thoughts and responses into the provided Google Doc instead of speaking out loud too much, so that they could have a record. The question asked was related to summed area tables for 2d matrices of integers. The interviewer did not seem impressed or friendly and immediately hung up after we discussed the single question. The recruiter got back to me one day after the phone interview to let me know that Google wanted me to fly to the Bay Area and interview in person. The travel setup was easy and they paid for flights, hotel, meals, etc. The in-person interview was made up of 4 hour-long interviews with a lunch interview in the middle. It took place in Mountain View on the Google main campus. The interviews were mostly one-on-one and I was asked coding questions on the whiteboard, questions about my resume, and questions that required analysis of existing/provided source code. Some of the topics were parallel execution, algorithms / tree data structures, image processing, and C and C++. About 2 weeks after the in-person interview my recruiter got back to me again to let me know that the team was ready to make an offer. The offer was good and the position was located in the Bay Area. I negotiated the signing bonus and stock grant upwards by a fairly significant amount using several other offers I had in hand.

I've applied online and met a recruiter at a university event. I'm an Electrical Engineering student that is interested in working as a software engineer. I didn't take any classes in my program to serve that purpose, therefor I self-educated myself. I bought books, did online classes, and took few CS additional classes at my university. With that said, I had to focus a lot on learning what any CS student must know, and I did that, but that didn't make me a perfect candidate yet. In my first phone interview, the only one I had, I managed to answer almost all of the questions. However, I found out that I lacked the ability to be a great user of the Java API and abilities when coding solutions. For example, I chose an array as my data structure for the solution, where maybe if I chose a linked list, I would have shown that I'm a stronger programmer. They called me 3 days after my phone interview notifying me that I was not chosen for the second on-site interview. However, the recruiter told me they were impressed by my resume, my analytic skills, and my knowledge in general. He said I need to practice coding more and I will be a great fit. He told me that he'll contact me again at the end of the year and set another interview without me even asking for it. So my advice would be this: Build a very strong knowledge of your preferred programming language. You have to show that you can utilize it the best way possible.

I answered all of the questions but didn't make it past the phone interview with the reason being I needed more experience writing professional code.

I was contacted by a recruiter for the position. Google's internship application process typically works as follows: two back-to-back technical interviews, hiring committee (if you pass the technical interviews), and then host-matching. Technical Interviews: In the first interview, I was asked questions regarding my resume and background. Then, my interviewer gave me the opportunity to ask any questions I had. Once this was done, we proceeded onto the technical portion of the interview. In the second interview, we began with the coding question. I was then given conceptual questions related to the material in courses I had already taken. In the remaining time, I was allowed to ask the interviewer any questions I had. Both interviewers were courteous and friendly. Hiring Committee: Two and a half weeks after my interviews, I heard back from my recruiter saying I had passed. My application was then sent to the hiring committee. I had no control over what happened here. The committee reviewed my interviewers' feedback and my resume, among other documents, to determine whether or not I was a promising candidate. Fortunately, I was. Host-matching: After getting the OK from the hiring committee, my application was thrown into the host-matching pool with all the other candidates who had passed the committee. In about two weeks, my recruiter notified me that a host was interested in speaking with me. My conversation with my host was rather brief and non-technical. I was told some details regarding the project, which I found to be interesting. I accepted the offer.

I feel so lucky that each interviewer starts with an easy question. And I complete these easy ones within 30 min. After such warm-up questions, each interviewer threw me another one which is as difficult as the medium questions on LeetCode. But they did not expect me to implement them in detail, rather they wanted me to explain the idea so that they can see how I approach to the problem. I was totally lost in one of these problems, and work out the pseudo-code solution on the rest. I just finish the interview and have no idea how it went actually, but I feel it is normal not scary at all. Hope I can hear good news from them later.

CONTEXT: I had been contacted by different Google recruiters over the past few years (and had been referred internally but I didnt know about that) and I had kept asking them to contact me later. FIRST CONTACT: I was then again contacted first for an S.R.E position. The recruiter took a mini 5-10 interview about time complexities and some Linux systems questions which they expected people to be well versed in. The recruiter was a little misleading about what the position was about and made it sound alot closer to S.W.E than it actually is. I did my research spoke with people who interviewed for SRE. I then insisted that I wanted to interview for SWE. The recruiter tried hard to convince me to apply for SRE but my heart was not in it. EVENTUAL CONTACT: After 1-2 conversations with the recruiter, I was then handed over to another recruiter for SWE. I had multiple conversations so that they can ascertain which team should interview me and what should be a good fit. They really do try to set you up for success, I can assure you that much. They were unable to initially be precise about which team I would be a fit for. So they suggested that I atleast do the phone interview (which would be reaosonably generic) and then that would give them some clues. PHONE INTERVIEW STAGE: I gave the phone interview and next day got an email that they want to move forward. I then spoke with a different recruiter who was supposed to handle my case. I again had some clarifying conversations with her about my strengths and interests and made sure that my onsite interview would be something that I expected it to be. This recruiter was fantastic and very detail oriented. I had limited time because I had 2 existing offers whose deadlines were approaching. They scheduled my interview on a day of my choosing. ONSITE INTERVIEW STAGE: The onsite interview went well. The interviewers were friendly and polite. Some young, some slightly older. They were excited to be a part of Google. I had a great time talking and solving questions. The interview questions were not very difficult. I concentrated alot on code organization, cleanliness and correctness. Debugging my code in the interviews and convincing myself and the interviewer of the absolute correctness was very important. If you are comfortable with recursion, Dynamic programming, Arrays, Trees etc that should be fine. I dont think they really wanted to test knowledge of advanced concepts. They concentrated more on basic fundamentals, good solutions, clean & correct code. There were 5 technical interviews and 1 lunch interview. The lunch interview was not technical. It was me who was asking the constant questions in that time. POST INTERVIEW STAGE: Since I was on a tight timeline, things moved at LIGHTNING SPEED. I couldnt imagine that it was possible for this to be done so soon. On the SAME DAY of my interview, I got a positive response and my packet for the Hiring Committee was being prepared. They checked out my references the NEXT day and by nightfall the next day, I knew I was approved by the hiring commitee. OFFER PHASE: The verbal offer was given 2 days later. 2 days of negotiation. I was given the final written letter basically within a week of my interview which I signed. Over all: The recruiter was diligent and FAST. I couldnt keep up, it was that quick. I was very lucky I would say to work with the right people. I made sure i myself was prompt at every stage.

First I was contacted by a college recruiter on LinkedIn. Set up a phone interview with the recruiter. The call lasted about 15 mins and we discussed my background, interests, and the Google interview process. Next, the recruiter forwarded my preferred technical interview times to a recruiting coordinator to set up a technical interview. Technical interview started with the interviewer briefly discussing what they do for Google, and asked a couple of questions about projects on my resume. Then jumped into the technical questions. Won't give the exact questions, but instead a general idea of what was asked. First question involved returning true or false for some condition regarding 2 input intervals. Could be approached in a simple one line return statement (by approaching as when is the input going to return false), or a less optimal solution of finding all of the cases where true is returned. Was not thinking and took the less optimal route. Realized that wasn't the best way after the interview. 2nd question was basically an expansion of question one. Given two inputs, a list of intervals and another interval. Function from part 1 can be used to do something with the list of intervals. Ran out of time to code if for the final edge case to be completely functional, but told interviewer what had to be done to make it work for all cases. The questions were not really difficult or unexpected, but making silly mistakes lead to a less optimal/not entirely functional solution. Recruiter called back within the specified timeframe with very very general feedback from the interviewer. Nothing specifically saying what went well (or not well). Recruiter told me that at the time they would not be continuing with my application.

Good: - Recruiter was quick (4h) to reach out to me once I applied via their website, although I did also notify my campus recruiter, so maybe that helped. - Recruiter was great at giving me review material, answering questions, and setting up the initial interview at my pace. Bad: - The interviewer called late, yet ended at the agreed-upon time. - The interviewer had poor signal, yet did not worry about moving somewhere else, which meant that he had to repeat himself many times. - The recruiter took one month to get back to me.

Applied online on careers website, got no answer even after 1 month. Applied to recruiter's inbox, got an interview date the next day, I was asked to make 3 consecutive ones. I delayed them with no problems because of my exams. The recruiter was really nice and understanding. Got to host matching, and now waiting for a match project. They notified me after 1 week of the interviews.

The first round was at my school. We did 3 interviews which were about 30 minutes each, testing my ability to code on the fly in my choice of programming language (Java, C++, python, go if you know it). After passing this round of interviews, I went into a project matching interview process, which were 30 minute phone interviews with potential hosts.

A Google recruiter contacted me early in the summer (I had interviewed with them previously), and set up a phone interview. I passed that, and they sent me an invitation for an on-site interview. The visit to their Mountain View HQ was very pleasant. I had two interviews, lunch with a Google employee, and another two interviews. I did not find the interview problems particularly difficult, and solved most of them well before time ran out, so I ended up with a lot of time to chat with the interviewers. I think I got them all correct (I hope!), because the interviewers didn't really have many comments about my solutions, and they didn't tell me that anything was wrong. They told me it would take around two weeks to give me my decision but it ended up taking ten weeks, because one of the interviewers left the company without turning in the interview feedback, so I had to do another phone interview. I think some other stuff got lost, so the recruiter contacted me and asked me to fill out some more forms. Either way, it took a really long time, and I was disappointed when I did not get an offer :(

There were a series of emails exchanged and I was passed through three different recruiters. I proceeded to an initial phone interview to discuss skills, background, and next steps. The recruiter I spoke with on the phone was curt. She asked a few broad questions, including why I would want to work at Google. I replied that I enjoy fast development with a small, agile team. She misunderstood me and suggested that I should apply to Facebook instead because they have a more constant release cycle. This question and her generally haughty tone left me feeling pretty defensive and not trilled about continuing. Nevertheless, I was given a technical phone interview a week and a half later. I did not know what to expect from the technical phone interview. I was sent an email detailing a long list of potential subjects, which I studied broadly. Instead, I should have been practicing coding problems. The technical interview consisted entirely of two programming questions. I coded on a Google Document along with the interviewer. I could only partially complete both questions. The first question was, "Given a binary search tree populated with numbers, find the closest match to an incoming number." The other question was, "Given an array of strings, find the common prefix." I left the interview knowing I had very little chance of continuing. Despite this, the recruiter called about a week and a half later to decline, but invited me to try again in "12-15 months". The call left a sour taste in my mouth as I again experienced a condescending attitude in a scripted call, especially when a simple email would have sufficed.

I applied online and heard back about a month later for interviews! Definitely wasn't expecting one, as I don't really have much experience but I suppose going to a top CS school helps. 2 x 45minute phone interviews. They are supposed to be back to back but there was a glitch in my first interview that caused us to reschedule. The time it took from my second interview to receiving an offer was less than 2 weeks. My recruiter was incredibly kind!

The process is pretty standard. Two phone screens followed by an onsite. The onsite was much more difficult than the phone screens and also the bar to clear is also high. Obviously, Google being a great company, there is nothing wrong with that. I would suggest their phone screens also have the same high bar as onsite. This will help in not wasting the candidates time/money and theirs. The onsite consisted of 5 sessions. The first two were dictionary and bit manipulation questions. The third was a question about how to design a system that handles and logs the urls clicked on. The last two were pretty tough graph questions for someone who does not deal with graphs in his daily work. Know the usual graph algorithms. Actually, you need to have them at your finger tips and being able to implement them in a matter of minutes so you can solve the real problem that depends on those algorithms. They seem big on graphs. I eventually got to the solutions to all the problems with a few stumbles along the way. But I guess my lack of confidence in tackling graph problems showed. The interviewers are friendly and professional. They give you clues when you are stuck. There is sometimes a shadow interviewer who is learning and taking notes. Practice writing code on white board.

A university recruiter reached out to me in mid-fall to schedule an onsite interview (I was previously an engineering intern at Google). I had a short non-technical phone call with the recruiter during which she asked me about my technical interests, what I was looking for in a full-time role, and what products at Google I wanted to work on. After that, she connected me with a recruiting coordinator to set up my flight, hotel, and interview day logistics. The interview day was alright but felt a little rushed and impersonal to me. I was told that my interviews would begin at 10am. My interview host for the day greeted me in the lobby a few minutes after 10 and rushed me to my first interview at 10:15am. The room was tiny (I could barely write my code on the whiteboard) and not very sound-proof. The day consisted of four 45-minute coding interviews in total. The first two were in the morning, after which I had lunch with a different Google engineer than my interviewers. I then had two more interviews after lunch. The questions weren't too difficult overall - mostly standard questions on algorithms and data structures on a white board. I got two on manipulating strings and arrays, one on binary trees, and one recursive problem simulating a board game.

The process started with a phone call from the recruiter that suggested to do a screening interview onsite. After a 1:1 screening interview onsite, there were 4 onsite technical and analytical interviews the same day. I passed all the interviews and then started talking with managers to choose a project. Something went wrong during these interviews, the positions were irrelevant to what I was looking for. The recruiter tried with a different location, find one option, and after talking with a manager, I was supposed to receive an offer. Unfortunately, the offer didn't arrive and they decided to finish the hiring process. The process took 3+ months from setting the screening to finishing the process.

The process took around 9 weeks. I applied online in mid October and got an interview call within a week. Due to other offers I asked them to expedite my interview schedule and they did so. I interviewed with them end of October and by the 1st week of November they confirmed I had gotten through to Host matching. Here's unfortunately where things slowed WAYYY down. After sending in my host preferences I had to push other offer deadlines multiple times as Hosts were slow to respond. I finally got matched with a host around the first week of December. One week later I was told that the hosts had decided to go with another candidate. It wasn't until the 3rd week of december when the recruiter told me that one of my previous hosts changed his position and would like to offer me the job.

The trip was organized quickly, and I had 4 technical interviews + 1 thesis discussion interview in one day.

Contacted by an excellent Google recruiter. Took some time to prepare for telephone interviews and, despite getting a bit flustered (I hate telephone interviews), I got enough leeway from the first to get a second. This led to a face to face interview, which I delayed until after a planned vacation. The F2F was an excellent day on site, if somewhat intense. It was very difficult to judge if you were going down the lines the interviewers wanted you to. Much of the advice online is to start working through solutions to the problems they set, starting with a simple idea and improving it as you go. However with a little hindsight I can see that this actually trapped me into a significantly poorer design during the architectural interview than I thought up on the train home! Despite not getting an offer, the recruiter had excellent feedback for me and explained that the hiring board had considered offering me other roles that would have played to my non-technical strengths.

Several recruiters from Google reached out to me a few times over the last few years - they were quite persistent. The recruiter clearly explained the official interviewing process to me. For some reason they skipped the phone interview for me, and the first time I spoke to any Google Engineers was on my in-person interview. I didn't officially "apply"until just before I scheduled the interview & didn't apply for any specific job. The questions were interesting & the engineers super smart, quite friendly, helpful, and sometimes awkward. I had five technical interviews in one room over the course of a day in the GoogleNY office during my in-person interview - most were one-on-one and one had a junior engineer sitting in. Each interviewer wrote down information about the specific question they asked on a sheet of paper, but each of the interviewers noted that they couldn't read the previous interviewers' handwriting. I was taken to lunch in the Google cafeteria. Everybody was very intelligent and excited about working at Google. I feel pretty good about working through solutions to all of the interview questions, but stumbled a little on my probability.

Initial contact came through a recruiter and HR. I was then connected to the hiring manager and had a phone interview with him. The phone interview focused on the relevant technical area (algorithm research & development), close to my expertise and expected area of work. This went well, and I was invited for a day of onsite interviews. The onsite interviews were disappointing. Both the recruiter and hiring manager were not available, and I did not get to speak to them at all. Several interviewers were not related to the team I was interested in and seemed to be randomly selected. They barely introduce themselves. Of course, most interview questions were computer science related, some very easy and some hard. Almost none of the interview questions were actually relevant to the position I was interviewing for. The interviews were very impersonal, the interviewers are focused on getting through their standard questions and recording my answers. They are not interested in your background or testing whether you can actually solve problems relevant to the position. As a result of the above, there is actually almost no relevant discussion or engagement with the interviewers possible. I received almost zero feedback from the recruiter afterwards, other than that "impressions were mixed".

1. I contacted my Google recruiter, who has been reaching out to me for several months. 2. I was invited to an onsite interview, which took ~6 hours total. There were 5-6 sessions, each of which lasted ~45 minutes. I was asked to write code on the whiteboard. Questions were pretty difficult, and assessed understanding of data structures, algorithmic problem-solving skills, communication skills, runtime analysis, system design, and programming languages. Overall, the interview questions were fair and tested my software engineering skill-set.

Gave them my resume at a university recruiting fair, the representative encouraged me to apply online as well so I did. Was contacted by an HR representative 2 weeks later, who set up an in-person interview at my university later. There, I talked to two recruiters. The first interviewer introduced himself, talked about my interests, and then gave me an easy warm-up question which I got through quickly (had to do with finding duplicates in a list). He then gave me a problem whose solution was essentially a convoluted definition of randomness, which I only got to after being heavily prodded. We ended up debating the validity of the problem for the rest of the interview, which I thought was fun. The next interviewer gave me a problem that involved recursion in manipulating a 2D matrix. I did the problem pretty well and ended up getting into some deep image processing stuff. He said he had a lot of fun and that he'd never gotten this far in the problem before. I was then contacted 2 weeks later saying they wanted me to go onsite. They flew me down to MountainView, where I interviewed with 3 software engineers and had lunch with a recent grad. Each interviewer briefly talked with me about my background and interests and gave me a long problem to work on. The first problem was sort of a systems design/navigation problem. Though my coding may have gotten a little sloppy here, I thought I did well. The next had to do with graph transversal. I figured out the optimal algorithm for this one very fast and had time to slowly and carefully code the solution. Last interview was a weird sting manipulation/recursion problem. I got a little lost in this one, but got the general idea and the interviewer said I did fine and that the problem was messy in order to see how people break down a big problem into smaller ones. 3 weeks later I was put through hiring committee, who said they wanted to make sure I found an appropriate team before they submitted me to executive review. The next week I talked on the phone for 30 minutes each with 3 hiring managers from various teams. I emailed back the recruiter about which one I liked best and they ended up wanting me on the team too, so it was a mutual fit. Two weeks later I went through hiring committee again and then to executive review and was offered the job! Overall, my interviewers were very nice and tried really hard to make me feel less nervous about the whole process. My recruiter was really on top of everything and contacted me often with updates about the process. Also props to google for giving someone with a non-standard background a change! (I'm a biomedical engineering and physics major, with a lot of coding experience and an interest in computer science. You don't necessarily have to have majored in CS to get hired at google!)

Then two back-to-back interviews were scheduled,which is two weeks later. The technical phone interview is really about algorithm,data structure and design. As long as you are in good shape, you should be able to make it to next round. Interviewers are very friend and willing to help you out. Then I entered the pool since the late of sep. Since all the intership starts late in Oct, so I have to wait at least one month for the host match. Then I got a match from kirkland in the early of Nov.

I was contacted by a recruiter after being suggested to the recruiter by a faculty member at my university. The interview process was relatively standard and fairly smooth. The first recruiter started with a phone call to describe the process (phone interview, onsite, job offer) and answer any questions. After that, we set up a time for a technical phone interview. The phone interview is a technical evaluation using a Google Document for coding. Prior to the interview, the recruiter gave me a ton of information and topics to study (which you can easily find with a Google search). I cannot share the specific questions they asked, but they were interesting CS problems related to algorithms and data structures (surprise surprise right?). After my phone interview, I was asked to have another phone interview and my recruiter handed me off to another recruiter (who got candidates for a specific team at Google). I suppose the second interview could be standard for some teams or I was marginally acceptable in the first interview. I do not know. The second interview was the same as the first, except a different engineer and different questions. After passing the phone screening stage, I was invited for an onsite interview in Mountain View. This was a definitely a great experience. There were 4 distinct interviews (along with tours, lunch, and the usual stuff). Each interviewer asked similar questions to those in the phone screenings (in difficulty). Once again, I cannot share the specific questions but the list of topics is freely available. Once the interviews are done, the hiring decision is made by a committee. Overall, the recruiters were very quick and efficient and always pleasant.

I was referred by a friend to be an intern. I had 2 phone screen interviews, where I wrote code on a shared Google doc in real-time while talking to the interviewer, and was told I passed by my recruiter. I then filled out a questionnaire about internship preferences (location/languages/types of projects), and was told by my recruiter that I would be contacted if they found a fit for me. A week later I matched, and had a phone interview with my intern host. Google values intern performance very highly, so I worked hard all summer and had great relationships with my host and manager. When I applied to convert to full-time, I had 2 on-site interviews and a lunch informational interview (lunch interviewer does not write feedback). Google hiring committee only meets once a week, so I waited 2 weeks to hear I made it through hiring committee, and an additional week to go through executive committee & compensation to get my offer. I was told during orientation that roughly 70% of interns receive conversion (to full-time) offers.

My other interview questions aren't online, so I won't spoil those...

This interview was tough, unlike my Microsoft interviews, I only got through 1 question per interviewer. The exception was one interview where I got through 2. When they say it's all about your thought process and not the answer, they really mean it. During one interview we walked through the process of solving the question together, then the last 5 minutes I programmed the solution. I actually thought it was over but a few days later, the recruiter submitted a package to the hiring committee to hire me.

An HR person contacted a week after I submitted application online around mid Oct. The phone interview was then scheduled to be early Dec. The phone interview was awful. A guy called. He did not say 'Hi' or 'How are you?'. He did not even introduce himself. He was very quiet and did not speak clear English. I had major difficulty hearing and understanding his accent. He did not tell me his name until I asked him 20 min into the interview. He was not very responsive to my questions for clarification or 'am I on track' kind of question. He did not recognize some of the most basic C/C++ conventions ( for example, a ? b : c ). He told me that my code was hard to understand and he was not sure if that code could work. He prepared two coding questions. Per the communication delay, it took me 35 min to finish the first one. He seemed rather impatient and did not ask me the second coding question at all. He doubted 'did you prepare for this interview?'. Then he said 'Oh, you are from physics, not computer science'. Clearly, he did not think I could do C/C++. Oh well, good for him. His voice was low, down, unhappy, and robotic. I tried to sweeten the atmosphere twice, unsuccessfully. Honestly, I think it is the interviewer's job to make the interviewing atmosphere pleasant to both parties. If you tape record our 43min conversation, you would feel that I was the interviewer and he was the interviewee. I had very high expectation for a Google interviewer. He was utterly unprepared at the best. I am just disappointed. Later on, I learned from some friends that they had similar experiences with Google interviews. Some Google interviewers are really nasty to deal with, say the least. Google is a great place in general. But I am nowhere near desperate for an offer. I would not consider Google in any near future and I will tell my friends to be prepared for some Google interviews like this.

Got referred by an employee, heard from a recruiter after only a few days. First a phone call to get the recruiter to know you and you to know the hiring process. Then 1-3 phone interviews depending on how well you do. If you make it, you will be invited to on-site interviews, which are typically 4-5 interviews on one day with different interviewers which are Google software engineers with more than 3 years of experience. You will have lunch with another Google software engineer, too, which will give you the opportunity to ask all kinds of questions. The interviewers usually do not ask much about you or your past work experience, 90% of the interview time gets spend with coding and logical thinking questions. Most coding tasks are in principle pretty simple but I gets hard to do them under the time pressure. The interviewers are told not give much feedback and some of them follow this rule to an uncomfortable extent. You will definitely need to code something within the interviews, but you can find about 75% of the coding challenges by clicking through the first ten pages of Google interview reports. Hints: - Think out loud. - Try to find out how much feedback the interviewer is willing to give by asking clarifying questions. - Prepare by doing some coding beforehand. - Start with a simple solution but mention that there might be better ones and think about them later.

I wouldn't say there was a specific most difficult or unexpected question, but overall I'd recommend studying Cracking the Coding interview and also be prepared to write code on a whiteboard.

I got contacted by a Google recruiter sometime in September about a new grad Software Engineering position in Mountain View. Following an initial phone call briefly going over my resume and talking about my interest in Google, the recruiter set up a 45 minute phone coding interview. Unfortunately, no one actually called me as scheduled for my interview, so I contacted my recruiter and she rescheduled. After this interview took place, I was contacted about a week later saying that they wanted to do a second phone interview before deciding whether or not to bring me onsite for final rounds. I had that set up a couple of weeks later and then heard back again within a week that they wanted to fly me out for onsite interviews. At this point I was also transferred to another recruiter who dealt with onsite interviews and the rest of the recruiting process. I was flown out in early November for a day of four 45 minute whiteboard coding interviews with a lunch break in between the first two and the last two. Overall, it was one of my better onsite interview experiences and the interviewers were receptive to actively participating in the process (not just telling you the problem and then sitting there in silence). I even had one interviewer who took extra time after the interview to go into more detail explaining another way that I could have solved the problem. The engineer I had lunch with was also very nice and helped to paint a good picture of what working at Google would be like. Following this, my recruiter made sure to keep me updated as to how things were going in the review process. I heard back in about a week that my feedback from the interviews would be going through the hiring committee. Then, a few days after that I heard back that I passed the hiring committee and needed to have my package submitted for executive review. About a week after this I got an email from my recruiter saying I had the offer! We discussed the details over the phone and I accepted the offer the following week. All in all, from onsite to getting the offer was a little over 2 weeks. While it was certainly a lengthy process (September - end of November) this wasn't all Google's fault and I appreciated the recruiters keeping me up to date every step of the way.

I applied online. The process takes 1~2 weeks. First phone screen with hr and it was smooth since not any technical questions. Second phone technical interview with senior engineer, the questions are basic and simple but I was too nervous so I kept getting stuck. With some hints I finally solved the problem awkwardly but I knew I did bad. One week later I got a phone call from hr said they were not going to move forward with my interview.

[Recruiter contact] The recruiter contact is incredible. I had two initial phone calls with my recruiter who wanted to hear how I'm doing with my preparation. She also called me later for giving me feedback after the interviews. [interviews] To be honest, I had the worst interview experience with Google. My interviewer very too straight forward and it seemed like they didn't care who I am. Also, there was no initial question about me. Instead, we had a conversation like that "Hey, is this xx?" "yes" "okay, let's start with the first coding question". My interviewers didn't even explain who they are or what they do. That made me feel very uncomfortable.

I did an initial phone screen, but had difficulty scheduling a phone interview. However, through Grace Hopper, I was invited without phone interview to the Pre-Hop day in which I was interviewed by two people in the morning and two people in the afternoon. The coding questions themselves were not difficult though one interviewer was not entirely clear about what he was looking for. Another interviewer gave me too much help for a logic problem which made me wonder whether she thought I was not capable of solving it by myself. Other than that, it was a great experience to get to know employees.

I applied online through their general link for internship applications. Was surprised to hear back just a few days later from a recruiting coordinator, who asked me to choose 3 time slots for phone interviews. The interviews ended up being about 3 weeks after our initial contact. The phone interviews were rather relaxed, the interviewers were very nice. I definitely over studied, I was memorizing complicated graph algorithms and other high-level topics and the interview questions ended up being much simpler than I expected. The three interviews were all back to back with 15 minute breaks in between, and I think I did pretty well overall. There was one programming problem (out of 6 total) I was not able to answer fully, and I'm going to be kicking myself about it for some time. I have not heard back from them yet (interview was yesterday), so no word on offer/ no offer.

They mailed me because i had applied for an internship earlier. We decided on a date for a phone conversation. I suggested using Skype because it would be an overseas call, but he said no. No make sure you are in a location with good cell reception or use a wire-phone. We talked for maybe 15 minutes, he asked questions about my background and what i enjoy doing. He asked me if i could write the quick sort algorithm. I said no i can't, sorting algorithms don't interest me. This seemed to be a deal breaker (i told him they did not interest me, but he did not care). He said he would send my application out into Google departments, and get back to me. After 1,5 months i contacted him and he told me i would not get any further. I asked why he said he did not know.

Telephone interview: It was little weird - the first question had to do with topological sorting, which I was able to solve and code. The second question was about max length pairs of words in a dictionary, which I was able to answer too. The problem - the interviewer didn't understand what I was talking! He made me explain things again and again, even though I had written them down on the shared doc. He was satisfied with my answer at last, the same answer that I was telling him from the beginning, and asked me to code it. He also mentioned at the end of the interview that I will be getting a call for the next interview soon.

Uploaded the CV, heard back from a recruiter 2 months later. Two phone interviews, one right after the another, both taking 45 minutes. The first one was more of an algorithmic test with some really detailed questions, while the second one was almost entirely about testing, both on a specific example and in general (i.e. knowing stuff like unit testing, code coverage, and specifically JUnit since the guy worked Android Wear). After the questions on testing, I was asked to design a simple algorithm to reverse a specific part of a string and code it up. Coding was done via Google Docs, while Hangout videolinks were used for communication. I'm currently in the host matching phase (passed both interviews), so I don't really know whether I'm going to get an offer or not.

Applied online with employee referral. Also talked to an engineer at a university career fair. Was then offered an on-campus (school) interview about a month later, which consisted of 2 45-minute interviews. A couple days after that, I was called on-site in Seattle, which consisted of 3 60-minute interviews. Since I had a competing offer, I was informed of the decision 3 days later by phone, with the recruiter informing me that the hiring committee did not approve of my hire. The process was really dragged out (considering I originally applied in early September) and they only left me an hour to respond to my competing offer. Google HR can be surprisingly disorganized. For example, half of the interviewers had an outdated copy of my resume on hand, from an application I had submitted 3 years ago.

Signed NDA and will respect the NDA. For a new grad, they focus primarily on CS fundamentals, so know your data structures and algorithms well. However, be able to think through your code design in terms of scalability, even if they don't ask you to parallelize the code. I think they test the same concepts as Microsoft does, but I'll summarize the difference between the two companies without revealing any coding questions. Microsoft will ask you questions like, "If apples cost $2 and bananas cost $3, how much does it cost me to buy 3 apples and 2 oranges?" Google will ask you a question along the lines of, "If apples cost $2 and bananas cost $3, and I have a $1 million dollars, how many unique fruit combinations can I buy?" Simply put, Google questions are more in depth and require more thought and finesse, even though the same concepts are used in solving them.   Answer Question

The process was fairly quick and lasted a couple of weeks in total. I applied online, I received an email the next day and had a phone interview with HR the day after. This was more like a sanity check rather than an interview. Typical questions like where do I see myself in 5 years, why Google and to describe my coding experience in Uni. Before the end of the phone screening she offered to set up a skype interview with a software engineer ( which means she had already made her mind before calling). This was scheduled for a week later and involved about half an hour talking about my experiences and another half to solve a coding problem. I did provide a solution, but not the one he was looking for. This was my first interview and it was a stupid move to choose Google for this.

After a career fair at my school I talked to the Google recruiter, who suggested I apply online within the next few days to be eligible for an on-campus interview in a few weeks. A recruiter contacted me 10 days later for a technical phone screen--seems I didn't make the on-campus interview. I arranged a for a phone interview, to take place in 5 days' time. The phone interview stretched on for >45 minutes. Connection wasn't very good. I was asked about experience, general knowledge, and two coding problems, one easier, one harder. On the easier problem I had to re-imagine the algorithm twice to get a time complexity the interviewer was satisfied with. On the second problem I got stuck for a few minutes on an off-by-one error. Recruiter called me later offering an onsite interview. I asked to be interviewed for the Seattle/Kirkland office so she transferred me to a different recruiter who handles that location. I scheduled the onsite as soon as I could (in about 2 weeks' time) because I had a deadline for another offer. Both recruiters were understanding and gave me prompt responses. The onsite was four technical interviews, each an hour long, with an hour-long lunch break in between. All five interviewers asked if I had questions, so by the end of the day I was grasping at straws for any new questions to ask. Each technical interview had two whiteboard coding questions of about equal difficulty. (On interviewer asked three coding questions, but the first was just a warm-up.) On two interviews I answered all questions before time ran out. On one interview, the interviewer made me realize the function I had just coded up wouldn't solve the problem, right as time ran out. I held him back for a few seconds as I drew out the correct solution on the board for him. On the last interview, the time ran out before I could code up the answer to the problem. It was all data structures and algorithms with no architecture questions, but that's probably because I was a new grad. One interviewer was friendly and enthusiastic. Two of them were pretty withdrawn, so I had no idea whether they liked what I was doing or not. The last one was blunt and quick to tell me when I was doing something wrong, but he also never brushed off my questions or weird algorithm ideas. Two weeks after the onsite interview, I got an offer for after graduation. I feel like coding interviews are just as much psychological as they are technical. You have to keep a cool head during a stressful situation and accept criticism with good grace. You also have to be able to communicate your ideas really quickly and effectively. I drew out diagrams on the whiteboard as I was brainstorming--having visual aids really helps.

I was contacted due to an open-source software I created in a very specific area. After two phone interviews that were closely related to topics close to my software I was invited to an on-site interview. The questions I got there were mostly general algorithmic questions, i.e. to write functions for a given task, such as "What is a deadlock. Give a code example that might cause one" and also about modifications and filtering of raw buffer data using bit operators. Most of it was out of my comfort zone as my expertise and the prospective job is in a very different areas so I had to improvise a lot, especially for the deadlocks and buffer data questions. There was surprising little questions concerning the area of why I thought I was invited. One of the questions I totally got lost and were not able to read that the interviewer tried to tell me to take a different approach. Also I did not take the chance after the interview to ask for the actual solution which might have spun a fruitful reflection about my admittedly silly attempts. I haven't yet gotten an answer for now I'll set it to "No offer" as that reflects what my gut feeling tells me.

I was contacted several years after submitting my resume. I agreed to go through interview process despite being already employed in a very good job. I was told to prepare for the technical interview based on a list of topics, which I did. However, the technical questions were not what I was led to expect based on the topics I was told to read up on (algorithms for sorting, tree traversal, etc.). All in all, I did not feel they were interested in the whole picture, just how well I could code. Not being a full-time coder, I didn't do particularly well, even though I am actually pretty good with a bit more practice. I think they should test more general problem-solving ability rather than get hung up on how well people code in a particular language, which anyone with brains can become good at with practice.

I don't remember the precise question I got hung up on. It was a relatively straightforward C++ coding exercise -- but it was one of my bad days :( Other than that, I didn't find the interview particularly difficult. For example, one standard question (which was answered correctly) was to explain what a virtual function in C++ is and to explain the disadvantage of using VFs.   1 Answer

About three weeks after submitting my application online, I was contacted to schedule two 45-min technical phone interviews with engineers. We worked over a Google Doc, and I was asked several technical questions and asked to write small snippets of code. I thought the questions were very fair, if not a bit too easy. The first phone interview was pretty much 100% problem based, with five minutes at the end for questions of my own. The second phone interview was less problem oriented and more concept oriented. They asked about my projects and interests, and also asked questions that required some critical thinking. I thought the first interview went okay, but not great. The second one, however, seemed to go flawlessly. A little over a week after my interviews, I received a call with an offer.

I was contacted by a Campus Recruiter after our University career fair. She set up a short phone interview to see what my background and interests were. This was followed by a 2 hour long technical interview on a Google doc while simultaneously talking to the interviewer on the phone.

1 HR interview, introducing basic interview process. Just need to answer some simple questions about your resume. After that, they will give you an email describing all the things you need to master before the tech interview. Including the site, type of questions, and so on. 2 Tech interview. Solve an algorithm problem. 1) Traverse a binary search tree. Find the sum of this tree. 2) Return all the subset of size k whose sum will be n Be sure to use topcoder, it's a wonderful site with great tutorial. And, even better, it gives you practice room which you can test your code to see your code's performance. However, my suggestion is that you start with google doc, because that's how you will really use in an interview. Only after you have finished coding in your google doc, you copy and paste your answer into your topcoder practice room system, and use that to test your answer. You should also do this within the time limit, which is not 45 minutes, because the real interview will leave some time for you to ask questions and some chat at the beginning. So it would be appropriate if you could solve the problem within 30 minutes, the problem will not be too hard, but it definitely needs strong preparation.

Recruiter contacted me on my old school email, said he had me resume on file from when I interviewed a couple of years ago. I talked with the recruiter very briefly over the phone. He described the role and asked me if it was something I would be interested in, seemed like a very heavy software coding role. I said it was, and then he asked for me to send an updated resume and he would setup the phone interview. Phone interview was setup for a week away. Interviewer called on a very poor phone line, and was probably on speaker phone. Luckily we moved to the google doc that was setup for the interview and when I could not understand the interviewer he would type the info on the doc. The interview was pretty straight forward.The interviewer asked three questions, two dealing with arrays, and one dealing with a linked list. I struggled a bit through the first question. I worked through it, and the recruiter asked the typical solution time complexity questions, and how can you make it faster, etc. Question 2 I struggled for about 5 minutes to come up with a solution. I was explaining to the interviewer my thought process as I was trying to come up with a way to solve the problem, but that just confused him and he asked if I would just code it, but I wasn't coding it because I had no ideas yet on how to solve the problem. :) After about another minute I came up with a solution. I started coding it and once the interviewer saw that once I had come up with a solution and was able to code it without a hitch he asked me to move onto another question. This was the linked list question, and I knew a solution right away and coded it without any issues. Somewhere in there he asked me "Do you have experience designing backend databases?" This is more of a question I would expect for a DBA role, not a typical Software engineer interview question. Anyway I answered him, and that was pretty much the end of the interview. He asked me if I had any questions and I did, and he gave a good answer back... This was my second interview with Google. The first one was a disaster, so I was pretty pleased with the outcome of this interview. I struggled a bit, but was able to answer the questions. Two weeks later I emailed the recruiter and asked if he had heard any results from the interview. He set up a time to talk and when he called he told me that I had done well in the interview but that they found another candidate better suited for the position. Overall a pretty good experience.

I heard back from google within a couple of weeks after applying as I had someone internally recommend me. The hiring process starts with a call with the recruiter. They are very friendly and they go over the recruitment process briefly. The first interview is a phone interview. It revolved around a design question. They will start with an easy problem and then keep adding complexity to it as you move on. This was more of a discussion. After about 15 minutes of the design question the interviewer wanted me to write some code for a completely different problem. They are fine with any language (Python, Java, C, C++ etc), I used python. The coding question was about regular expression something basic. I cannot reveal the exact question as I have signed NDA. Within a a few days the recruiter got back to me and scheduled an onsite interview. Since I wanted to prepare well for the interview I pushed the onsite interview out a few weeks. The onsite consisted of 5 interviews. Instead of listing out each interview I will give a general overview and some pointers that may help. I am a machine learning scientist and not a software engineer. So I brushed up on data structures (Arrays, Lists, Hash Table, Graphs and Binary Search Tree) and algorithms ((n)log(n) sorting, BFS/DFS, In Order/Pre-order/Post-Order Traversal etc). I also practiced coding question from top coder. A good place for basic comp sci stuff is the algorithms and data structure course on Coursera by Tim Roughgarden. One thing to keep in mind is that you must always know the time and space complexity of any code that you write. It will always be asked. It is a good idea to go through your solution with the interviewer before you start writing code. The interviewers are friendly and they will point you in the right direction if you have any problems. Always keep the interview a 2 way conversation. Ask questions if you do not understand something. In my experience they do not care as much about the final answer as much they care about your thinking process. So think out loud, this really helped me. Practice writing code (proper syntax) on a piece of paper because during the interview you will be asked to code on a white board. Last but not the least don't get demotivated if you do badly in one interview, try and ace the next ones. I completely messed up one interview in which I was not able to answer the question at all. The question was on recursion for a hypothetical tree data structure. I absolutely could not get the interviewers hints but I never gave up and kept on trying till the interviewer was tired moved

The interview process was handled in a very profesionnal manner throughout. It's great to know that your recruiters will accommodate your schedule (e.g. give you a few weeks to prepare if you need that time) and keep you updated at every stage. Although I originally applied for a non-engineering job (given my background), I got contacted by a recruiter who asked if I was willing to apply on the software engineering track with a focus on my niche skills. Since it didn't hurt to try and actually learn about computer science fundamentals, I gave it a shot. I was interviewed by 6 people total (1 phone screen + 5 onsite interviews in a single day with lunch in the middle). Over the course of the process, I was in contact with 2 recruiters, one for the phone screen stage, one for the on-site stage. Some of the interviewers seemed to be aware of my niche skills and had obviously been selected to interview me based on the match between their skills and mine. Some of the interview questions did reflect that concentration but most didn't and were focused on CS fundamentals, algorithms and data structures. Overall, it was fun and challenging.

I was initially contacted by a recruiter via email. I replied and we set up a phone call. The recruiter was pushing me towards a Software Engineer in Test role, even though that's not what I currently do - in hindsight I think that was probably a major reason why I didn't get an offer. Throughout the recruitment experience I kept getting handed off from one recruiter to the next - I think in total there were 5 different people I had to deal with before the interview. It all seemed very disorganized. One of the recruiters set up a phone screen with an engineer which I passed without issues - there weren't really any challenging questions. For the onsite interview they were trying to make me travel to Mountain View but I wasn't interested in that so they eventually set up an interview in Seattle for me. The interview was a whole day, I think it was 5 or 6 technical interviews each lasting 45 minutes, and a lunch break with an employee who they claim doesn't submit any feedback. When I first arrived there in the morning the receptionist had a list of people interviewing that day but I wasn't on that list - further disorganization. She eventually worked out who was supposed to meet me. After the interview I didn't receive any communication from Google for 2 weeks so I decided to email one of the many recruiters and ask if there was any updated. They told me the engineers were busy with peer reviews at the moment so not all feedback was in yet. Another 2.5 weeks went by and I finally got an email that the recruiter wanted to set up a phone call. He called me the next day to inform me that I hadn't passed the interview which I was quite surprised by.

Had to sign an NDA so won't break that here. Overall there wasn't anything too challenging, I've come across more difficult questions in interviews. The more difficult ones were open ended questions about how to test a google service.   Answer Question

Reached by a recruiter. She was nice and provided me with a detail list of prep material. The technical interview did not go well. The interviewer had a strong accent and we didn't understand each other half of the time. The first question is easy--find common elements in 2 sets. He asked me about time complexity. I answered correctly but there came the communication barrier. He did not hear me correctly and I wasted a lot of time explaining my thought. Then next question is about scalability. What if the sets are very large(10TB)? I did not prepare for that. The third question is a brain teaser: if 1000 couples are to give birth to male and female babies(50% change each), and they would keep giving birth until they have a girl, what's the boy to girl ratio in 20 years. I got this one. Finally reverse bits of an integer.

Having done the interview for both types of positions, I can say the general format of the interview remains the same, but there are noticable differences in the style of questions. That said it is an interview designed so a new graduate will actually have a better chance than 20 year veteran. Someone who is unemployed and can dedicate weeks preparing will do better than someone who can just squeeze in a weekend of refresher study. A CS major will do better than a physicist. Your references, experiences, etc will not aid for the interview. So even if you have several VP's as reference, you still need to pass the interview before that will taken into account. As to what the interview feels like. Imagine you decide to sit in on a mid-level undergrate course at MIT like CS 170. The instructor recognizes you and asks you to teach the class. So you are up in front of at the white board trying to present solutions to problems you might not have ever seen before that day. Now imagine doing that 5 or 6 times in a row. That is what it feels like. When you pull it off and come-up with a good solution, it feels really nice. When you hit something where you spend most of your time just really understanding the problem and do several false starts, it feels really embaressing. That said, with free online university courses available, and a wealth of reference materials available, I feel like this is an interview anyone can pass, if and only if they have the adequate amount of time to prepare. Finding that time can be difficult if your current job keeps you working 60+/hours a week, and your family keeps you busy for the rest. That is probably why you see many more young faces at google than older ones. It just becomes so much harder to find the time... But at least if you know what to prepare for and have some time, you have a fighting chance.

I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn. She set up an initial phone "interview" with me to find job openings at Google that were suitable for my background. The recruiter was very nice and helpful. She informed me about the interview stages and how to prepare for them. The initial stage was a technical phone interview which would involve coding in Google docs. I gave her my availability and the interview was set up. Take as much time as you need to prepare for the technical phone interview. It is best to be prepared than to rush into it. I wasn't well prepared, so I didn't make it to the next stage.

None of the questions were really difficult in a logical sense after preparation from provided materials, but I think I misinterpreted the question the second interviewer gave me after later reflection.   Answer Question

Got my initial phone interview through an employee referral. This was followed up with a second phone interview since I didn't do too well on my first one, I think. I did manage to get to an onsite interview in San Bruno with four interviewers. However, I ultimately failed to get hired.

I applied through Google's online web form, and was very surprised to be contacted by a Google recruiter a couple of weeks later -- I had no contacts at the company, and applying via web forms usually doesn't work. After some short communications with the recruiter, I scheduled an on-site interview in New York City. The best part of the Google interview process is that they tell you exactly what to expect. The recruiter sent me a list of topics and suggested study materials, and the interviews didn't have any questions that weren't covered in that list of topics. I spent about three weeks studying for the interview, and didn't have any surprises when I finally got there. Google is very good about arranging transportation for the interviews. They covered all costs for me to fly to NYC and spend one night before my interview. Google paid for airfare and hotel directly, and reimbursement for meals and public transit was quick and easy. After the in-person interviews, there were two stages of hiring committees. (I heard about this from my recruiter, but didn't have any contact with the committees beyond my on-site interviews.) During this time, I had phone interviews with several team leaders, trying to figure out where I would best fit. Part of this process was for the Google managers to decide if they wanted me, but it was at least as much for my benefit -- after several of these phone interviews, I picked the team which seemed to be the best fit for me. Everyone was very friendly, and the entire interview process was smooth and enjoyable.

A recruiter reached out to me by e-mail. The phone screen lets me implement an algorithm to sort a list into the form s1<s2>s3... I gave an nlogn solution (which is not optimal) but then I passed this round and got an onsite interview. I don't quite remember all of the questions. One of them involves walking diagonally on a chessboard... certainly it needs more intelligence than just going over the Cracking the Code Interview book. And I have only went through a few chapters of the CTCI... One thing that disappointed me is that the recruiter did not gave me interview feedback. I know most other Google interviewers have got it, but I pinged my HR twice and did not get a response after she left me a voicemail in my phone and said that I was rejected.  Anyways this is the first ever onsite interview I have had, and it's with Google. I'm already thrilled to get pass the phone and be onsite. Also, the lunch is good. So I am giving it a positive review.

Contacted by a recruiter - my former colleague referred me. I wasn't asked to do a phone screen because my another former colleague joined in Google and recommended me. The HR is quite responsive to onsite interview scheduling and answering my questions thoroughly. There were 5 interviews, one of which had two interviewers together. Those guys all seemed to be quite nice except one kept typing instead of interacting with me.

One of the sessions was about system design. The question was extremely vague but the questions I was asked were very specific. I guess the biggest part of the solution was to infer what exactly the interviewer was getting at.   Answer Question

I first was contacted by a Google recruiter on LinkedIn. During the initial online meeting I was brought up to speed on how the recruiting process works at Google. I decided to take on the challenge and the recruiter arranged the initial technical screening, which was conducted online as well. The intial technical screening seemed fair to me, starting with a moderate problem that can be solved in many ways, ensued by a more intricate problem where a couple of hints helped me to get it right. After a few days I got the positive answer from the recruiter and I was invited to the Google Zurich office for the on-site interview, which took place about a month later at my request. The on-site interview was tough, don't expect any less. Each of the 5 sessions started with a moderate question that can be solved with adequate training (e.g. LeetCode). And each of the sessions will become more difficult after solving the initial problem - the interviewer wants to see you reach your limits. Expect to be mentally drained when leaving the Google office. After two weeks of waiting I got feedback from the recruiter and was informed that I did not qualify for the job after all. My impression is that Google is looking for people who excel in specific areas, not allrounders. And don't expect them to be impressed by any soft/language skills you might bring along.

I put up a sparse profile on LinkedIn and was contacted in a few days. The first call was from an HR person and was very short. Just a cursory look at the interview process and a appointment scheduling. Also, I was given an email with a great deal of study material. Second call was a 45 min technical interview. I got the first question in about 25-30 minutes then the interviewer asked me other questions about my resume. We never got to the second I got a call back a week later or so saying they wanted to fly me out. The on-site was four interviews and a lunch in the middle. The final interview had a second employee sitting in a shadowing the interviewer. After this, it was about a month until they got back to me with the verdict.

Get email from recruiter stating that they wish to contact me because I dropped my resume last year, and see if I am still interested to this position. After that I had an interview with one of the engineers. Interview was fair, including some behavior questions and one technical question. I was asked to talk about the algorithm to the problem, its complexity before writing it down on google doc. After I finished I was also asked to state any potential problems. After 2 days I got a call from recruiter and said I need to have a second phone screening from another engineer. The 2nd interview was pretty much the same format as the first one besides there are more behavior, and there are two technical. The interviewer only asked me to give the algorithm to the first one, and I need to actually write down the code for the second one. I cant finish writing, because the interview is limited in one hour, and the interviewer called me somewhat late. Recruiter called me few days later to inform me I didn't get through to the final round.

A recruiter first makes a call and ask about your background and your interest, and then will send you an email indicating what kind of questions will be included in technical interviews. I had two on-site interviews: first by 3 interviewers with half an hour each; second by 4 interviewers, also with half an hour each.

I was asked "How would you find the longest substring of a string containing only one character?" this was then expanded to two characters, etc. The second question was "How would you reverse just the vowels in a string?" They then asked what I'd do if the string was too big to fit in memory.   2 Answers

They said I'd hear back in around two weeks, and I heard I was unsuccessful 16 days later.

HR staff calls you to talk about your interest in the job, your location preference, and the interviewing process. They schedule for you a phone screen interview. The phone screen is a 45 minute technical interview: you code with the interviewer in a Google Doc. If you pass the phone screen (or two), you're invited to on-campus interviews. On-campus interview takes all day: 4 or 5 technical interviews of 45 minutes each, plus one hour lunch with an engineer. Each technical interview you are talking to one engineer, solving technical problems by describing algorithms and coding on the white board. Interviewers want to see how you think and code. They don't ask about your past experience or education. Your interviews submit their reviews to a hiring committee, which makes the decision whether to make an offer. It takes about two weeks for the HR staff to call you back to let you know if you got an offer.

Applied through a recruiter about 1+ year after first contact. There were only phone screens and an on-site interview; no coding interview over the phone (perhaps because I was referred by somebody inside). Their preparatory e-resources helped, but the space of possible questions is limitless, and there's only so much that one can study. Personally, it's been 10+ years since I last had to delete a node from a binary tree, so my algorithms were rusty, although I did study. During the on-site visit, there were five technical interviews plus lunch. I'd say all were considerate and respectful, but two of them were not very polished communicators, in my opinion. My lunch was accompanied by a friendly engineer -- the best part of the day.

Applied online through Google's website on a Thursday night. I received a response from Google the following Monday. The response was a set of instructions to take a 60 minute test consisting of 2 programming problems from Codility within 1 week. This test was to determine where my level of programming skills were at after graduation. The tests from Codility were straightforward, but the difficulty was trying to write an efficient code with the best run time. Finding the best run time for certain problems can be found by reading interview questions books for Google, Amazon, Apple, or any of the large internet companies. It's highly recommended you review data structure, algorithms, and your preferred programming language. You need to be fast and stay calm.

Applied online without referral. Recruiter reached out to me. I filled a questionnaire to indicate my interests. Got two phone interviews. They were not very hard. After the phone interviews, you learn in a few days if you have passed. Then, you are in a pool and wait for someone to be interested in you. If you know people at the company, definitely let them know so that they can inform their friends that you are looking for an intern host. If someone is interested, a host interview is set-up. This is usually non-technical and only to see if you are interested in the project. If no one comes up after some time, they defer your application to next internship season. Next time, you directly enter the pool without any additional interviews. Recruiter is also a key person. Sometimes, they look out for you, sometimes they don't care.

Once in a while I get approached by a recruiter from Google. My experience with their recruiters has been quite bad. The first time I was told there were several interesting positions, and I did some tests (including online coding etc.) the recruiter came back to me telling that the position was already filled however, but that I passed nonetheless. The next time there would be an open position he would come back to me. He didn't. After that I decided I would hold off on Google for a bit. When I was approached again after two years, I decided to give it another go, since the recruiter (different person) knew I had applied in the past. I was asked to provide dates / times to be called, I gave them some; after these passed they contacted me that unfortunately they were unable to call me then, so we settled on another date / time. They never contacted me, I mailed them saying I was not amused by this, and they never bothered to reply. I get an impression that recruiters apparently get someone applicants, they don't really care a lot and then to be sloppy with individuals. There are probably enough people out there who really want to work for Google.

Recruiter approached me through linked in; followed by two phone interviews with the recruiter. The recruiter was nice and everything are smooth. A online coding interview is arranged two weeks later. There were no warm up talking about the coding interview. The interviewee seems not knowing anything about my background. I am a low level software developer. The coding questions are on high level design patterns and classes that I am not familiar with. Therefore, I spend more time than I expected. In the end, although the interviewer agree that my approaches are in correct direction, I know that I can not pass this round of interview.

I was contacted by a recruiter for Google in February 2014 for a new graduate software developer position. The interviews were outlined as follows (but were punctuated with many conversations with my recruiter): 1) Phone interview with recruiter to assess goals and ideal company culture. I'm sure that other topics were discussed, but it felt more like I was being sold on the company than being interviewed. 2) 1 hour technical phone interview using a Google Doc. I was given a small problem that required a lot of thought and had multiple solutions. The problem itself only required basic computer science knowledge, but was heavily dependent on your problem solving abilities. 3) 4 on site interviews in one day. I can't discuss what transpired, but I can confidently say these were the toughest interview questions I've ever encountered. The day felt incredibly long, and by the time I got to my final interview I was already mentally exhausted. Now in August, I'm still waiting to hear back from my recruiter.

How would you design Google Images?   1 Answer

Aug 26, 2014
---------------
I contacted Google through their website and applied for a software engineer in the Tel Aviv Office. There was an initial phone call with an HR recruiter (I think a day after I submitted my online application) - Just general questions about who I am and what I am looking for. After around 1 week I came to the on-site screening interview - 45 minutes of relatively simple graph questions - DFS/BFS stuff, and maybe a bit more complex questions regarding binary trees, but nothing too special. The interviewer told me I did well, but that I should be a bit more careful about the aesthetics of the code. 2 weeks later I came to my whole day interview session - There were 6 interviews - I would say 3 which were more algorithmic, 1 which was almost pure coding, and 2 which were "design". The design interviews I remember - 1) Design an online battlefield game - What would be the protocols between the server and the client, the algorithms and game flow to decide the state of the game, some basic networking (which I struggled with). 2) How would you design Google images? The premise was that I should be able to search regarding specific features, for example the blue content, or images that are in pages that contain specific keywords. This was a very open-ended question, we thought "together" about solutions, what will be the size of my data which maps words to images, where would I store the images, how many servers I would need, etc... I had no previous experience in large scale design - The interviewer said that it wasn't expected of me. I thought I did relatively well, but I guess they ARE looking for people with previous experience in large scale design, from the input I got later on. Algorithmic interviews I remember - 1) How would you design an efficient algorithm to find out in a sorted array which number appears the most times. I started from the simple solution, and continued to a more complex one ( with some hints along the way from the interviewer) that in summary does a binary search of the number of times the most frequent number appear - (think about it - I have an array of size N, if the most frequent number appears N/2 times, then I can infer this just from sampling the values at indexes (0,N/4,N/2,N*3/4,N). I thought I did well in that interview. 2) Write code that prints the Cartesian product (row by row for each combination) of a given list of lists (that contain integers). Since you don't know from beforehand how many lists there are, you obviously can't just hard-code lots of for loops. During the interview I gave two solutions - A recursive one, and after writing it out, they asked me to also write a non-recursive one - Which I did with a counter which maps each times to a different combination of values (with some mod mathematics). I think I also did well in that interview. There was a lunch break where it was obvious they simply told someone that today "you have to eat lunch with a candidate". It was a bit awkward at first, but it did give me a chance to interrogate him about how it is to work in Google. The food was extra yummy. After one week I got a response that I didn't pass the interview process. The guy stressed that I was "Close", that I did really good on 2 interviews and a bit less good on the other 4. Oh well. My preparation to the interview consisted of doing all the regular algorithmic/coding questions - I think that did prepare me well to the relevant interviews. But there was no real preparation to the more general "System Design" interviews - I think it's a bit more difficult to prepare for those, but I guess I still would have invested in that more time, retrospectively. Otherwise - I thought I did pretty well in the interview day - I guess that they can be REALLY picky about taking people who really did perfect in each and every interview. Just for reference I had an interview day at Facebook a few days later - I thought I did much better at the Google interview day, but ended getting an offer from Facebook and not Google. I guess also some luck doesn't hurt. The responsive of the hiring recruiter was always prompt. He was very nice, though at times it was a bit ridiculous - telling me again and again to call him If I have any problems, even if it's during the weekend or late at night. I mean it was nice to have a sponsor that "cares for me" during the process, but there's no need to push it...

Google's actively seeking software engineers so it's not difficult to get an interview, but don't let that trick you into believing the interviewing process is easy. They're looking for engineers that have both good analytical and design skills. Once you're set up with a recruiter, he'll be your point of contact in terms of scheduling interviews. You'll first be given a phone interview and if you pass that, they'll bring you on-site for several 1:1 interviews.

Was approached by a recruiter, we had an initial phone screen. From there, I had a technical phone interview with a SWE. The questions were pretty straight forward, nothing too difficult. After that, I had four on-site interviews. Two of them went very well, one went pretty well, and I did pretty poorly in the other. I signed an NDA, so I can't go into details, but my suggestion to anyone would be to prepare as much as you can.

Recruiter was very helpful, but the whole process can take a few weeks. Usually 4-5 technical interviews about algorithms and data structures. Each one gave a problem with a specific question but it develops several concepts. Be sure to think outloud and start from something simpler if you are stuck. Pretend the interviewer is your colleague. Spend some time beforehand practicing code on a site like hackerrank.com so that you are comfortable writing code on command.

They came to my school (UCI) and interviewed a good amount of people. Each candidate was given two 45 minute interviews. They ask difficult questions but not as difficult as a full time position. Then if you do well in that you go into host matching where they try to find an internship suitable for you after you give them your preferences. They described an internship and it sounded fun, but I later found out it was a very annoying project and was not satisfied with the initial description.

First step was to submit an application through Google's online system, which included a resume and (optional) cover letter. I was contacted by a recruiter within 3 days (including the weekend) and set up an interview for 2 weeks from that date. It was two back to back technical phone interviews. The interviewers let you choose what language you wish to demonstrate your knowledge in. I chose Java for both. My first interviewer was great. He introduced himself and throughout the interview, was very proactive on trying to guide me through a difficult part of the problem or hinted if he wanted more to the solution. I had to constantly verbalize my thought process, as it was a phone interview, so he mainly responded to that. My second interviewer was not so great. He was 10 minutes late and seemed like he didn't want to help at all. Even after his "explanation" of the problem, including a confusion-inducing analogy, I was still a bit uncertain about the problem, so I just went with what I thought was right. It ended up being mostly correct until he literally started to yell at me over the phone for the last line, which was parsing an object to an int, then back to an object when there was another method that did what I was trying to do already (which he didn't explain, so I didn't know what it was, go figure). He seemed to not be paying attention at all, as there were multiple times where I asked a question, only to be answered with silence. After that, I received a follow up email from the recruiter, stating I would know the results in a week or so. I ended up not getting the position (most likely due to that second interviewer), but am not deterred from applying again. I will admit my Java was definitely not up to par, considering that wasn't the dominant language I programmed in for the past half year and only really "studied" for two weeks before the interview.

Day 0 — I apply to seven different Software Engineer positions in the Bay Area simultaneously via their website. Day 0 — 38 minutes later, I receive an email from a Recruiter (call him R1), who's also an Engineering Manager (?). He asks when we can talk over the phone about "matching me up with the right opportunities at Google." I send a timestamp back. Day 2 — Phone call with R1, about ten minutes. He asks to tell him about myself, what my background is, what I'm interested in, why I want to work for Google, etc. He ends by telling me we'll set up a phone interview, which I intentionally schedule for a couple weeks later. (R1 asks me to choose a programming language for the interview, and mentions that he'll be sending me a syllabus to prepare.) Recruiting Coordinator 1 (RC1) emails me the details of the phone interview, which we confirm. Day 9 — Still no syllabus. I email R1. He sends me a verbatim excerpt from the Steve Yegge blog post you've already read. Day 15 — Phone interview day. 25 minutes into the schedule time slot, no call. I email RC1. Auto-reply: that account no longer exists. Great. I wait a bit longer. I give R1 a call; no answer, leave a voicemail. He replies within the hour, says he's sorry, asks for availability to reschedule. I reply. Day 23 — Phone interview finally rescheduled for day 28, by new Recruiting Coordinator (RC2). Day 28 — Phone interview, take two. Interviewer (a Software Engineer) asks me a little about myself, then moves on to the questions (I won't go into details, due to the NDA). About twenty minutes of basic Q&A about my language of choice (nothing remotely advanced). Then he asks me to describe (just out loud) the 'find' method of a common data structure. Then he modifies the problem definition slightly, and asks me how I would change the 'find' method. This seems fairly straightforward to me. He asks me to implement it in Java in a shared Google Doc. I do. I step through it with some examples. That's about it. I hang up: I think I nailed it. Day 36 — I email RC2 to check for any feedback. She defers to R1, who within minutes invites me on site to interview. I send my availabilities. I receive confirmation of my interview from RC2. I confirm, and send back two filled out forms (application + NDA; travel form). Day 37 — I make my travel arrangements through their travel agency. They pay for my flight, lodging for the night before and night after, rental car for the duration, transportation to the airport, and food for the duration. (I easily add two more days at my own expense.) Day 37 — R1 emails me to tell me he's leaving Google. R1 introduces R2 (not an engineer, this one). Day 38 — R2 emails introductions and asks when we can talk by phone. Day 42 — Introductory email from RC3, with two documents which are, again, verbatim excerpts of Steve Yegge's famous blog article. Day 43 — Phone call with R2, describes the on-site interview; nothing I didn't already know, except (fairly useless) one-line bios of my four interviewers. Eventually I start wondering why I'm seeing and hearing "Google/YouTube" when it used to be "Google," so I ask. I find out I'm apparently applying for YouTube now and no one bothered to tell me. R2 also tells me she won't be able to make it to greet me on the day of my interviews, so R3 (also not an engineer) will be replacing her. Day 54 — On-site interviews. I show up to the wrong lobby, having assumed there was only one. (Pro-tip: check your email from the Recruiting Coordinator for the exact building and address.) Luckily, I was early enough to make it to the right building on time. Interview, interview, lunch, interview, interview. No breaks at all between interviews. Interviewers either give you a blank expression with no feedback as you talk or else hold your hand all the way to the solution. No middle ground. Half the interviewers didn't seem to want to be there. Thought I did kind of okayish in three, badly in one. Very hard to tell over all, but I was pretty sure I wasn't getting an offer. Day 57 — Within three minutes of each other, emails from both R2 and R3, asking to talk over the phone. I sort out the disorganization, get a call from R3, and am informed I will not be moving on. The only feedback I can get is that my "coding" is lacking, which doesn't make much sense to me. Day 58 — On to other companies. (Day 73 — Still no reimbursement of expenses...)

Google is remarkably quick at getting back to applicants when applying through directly on Google's employment opportunities page. I received an email two days after submitting my resume and was asked to schedule two back to back 45 minute interviews the following week. Each interview was technical in nature and I was asked to solve two coding questions by typing code into a shared Google document with my interviewer. After asking questions and coding my solutions, the interviewer and I went over my solution and discussed aspects of it such as the running time, security and readability of the code. I did not get past the first round but was pleased by the swiftness of the process.

45 minute phone interview: program a computational geometry problem, the phone interviewer did not ask anything else at all. onsite: preparation: I prepared for two weeks.

So I basically took, the online versions of Prof: Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms class @ Stanford and parts of Prof. Erik Demain's class on Advanced data structures. @ mit. Also geeksforgeeks.org also helped me. Even if you don't get into google, I would say that taking these classes are very good for your future technical skills. 5 people interviewed me, 45 minutes each. None of the 5 interviewers asked me any algorithm heavy questions. There was no topcoder style questions either. Most of the questions were related to my domain area viz: computer vision and machine learning. Since I had just switched into these areas, I was not an expert and my answers were often patchy. One of the interviewers asked me a question on large scale system design. I am just waiting for the results.

Applied online and received an email within a few days by a Google recruiter. A technical screening interview was organized for the following week. A Google engineer called me and started by introducing himself and Google, then went quickly into the programming question. I managed to solve the problem using recursion within about 40 minutes with only a few hints. After 1 week, I received an email for onsite interviews which was organized for the second week after. The first onsite interview went well. I actually recognized the interviewer from my previous university. The programming task involved class declarations and pointers. I believe I did ok with this question but ran out of time to really give a solid solution. In my second interview, the interviewer gave me a few hints since I was not making progress and I eventually solved it. Then it was lunch with another engineer. My third interview was the worst. He asked me the same question as the 1st interviewer, and I said I had already been asked that question. He then asked a different question that I did not fully understand which direction he wanted to go and in the end it was an SQL command question. I made a mistake in the third question he asked: I started coding before I had fully considered the entire question. The 4th interview was a presentation of my work. This went smoothly and the interview was very cordial. The 5th interview went well although I ran out of time. 2 seemingly simple coding questions. Even though it was past time, this interviewer kept talking about the groups within Google so I thought I did well with this guy. Overall I managed to solve all the questions but with hints. I believe I did well with 3 interviews, 1 ok, and 1 bad.

One out of the 5 on-site interviewers was super unfriendly (and just came out of the shower w/ wet hair). She presented a graph problem which I considered my speciality. It had one tweak which she explained very badly. I asked her to reexplain the tweak twice. Then I was like "I understood it that way. So I'd do it this way. What do you think?". She then told me to "just implement it". I implemented it very fast. In the meantime, she read my CV. When I concluded, she looked at the code (which was probably 15-20 LoC). She then noticed that the way I handled the tweak was different to what she said. So she was like: "I told you to do it that way. What did you do there?". While I felt a little offended because if she had put a little more effort in explaining it I would have gotten it right away. Her version would have been even easier to implement.

Recruiter contacted me via email or linkedin, can't remember exactly. Asking if I would be interested in Google. I have a long resume and somewhat specialized set of skills in embedded systems so I said ok I will give it a go, but that I am not quite sure how my skills would be useful at Google. They waived the phone screen and moved me directly to an onsite interview. They send you a list of things to go over to prepare for the interview that looks like something out of college computer science course. I was really busy at my current job so I had little time to go over it, but it was fun revisiting the basic algorithms and data structures. Onsite was 3x45 miutes 1on1 interviews, lunch and 2 more 45 mins sessions. All back to back, no breaks other than lunch. 1st session: Interviewer introduced himself gave me time to introduce myself for the 1st 10 mins. Then asked 2 questions. 1st was arrays didnt require to writ code, 2nd was dynamic programming asked to wrote code. I did well on both so we had 10 more mins to spare where I asked him questions. 2nd session: Introduction took a really long time, interviewer talked at great length about himself and his work. Asked me if I am interviewing for real or just there to get some interview experience, because apparently thats what he did initially himself. When we got to the question there was only about 15 mins left. Tree related question, that in my opinion wasn't really presented very well. Code was required. I started solving it but he was basically walking me through every step. Not sure if he just wanted to pass me or realized that he already spent too much time talking. Got the correct solution, but I felt like I was being lead to it. 3rd session: Embedded systems engineer, asked me a lot about my actual resume. In the end asked me a pretty basic question embedded system specific, asked to write code. Was really easy for me, did really well. Probably the most enjoyable session. Lunch: The weirdest part of the day. Interviewer only got notified the night before, didnt look like wanted to be there. Didn't even know where the closest cafeteria was. Ended up walking for about 15 mins around the campus. Dropped the tray when getting food and spilled lunch over clothes, got really upset. Then suggested we sit outside because its quieter there. But the day was hot and it was really uncomfortable, I was glad to get back inside. 4th session: Usual introductions. General distributed systems question. Went pretty well in my opinion, but then I am not a distributed systems specialist, so cant really judge. 5th session: The worst one ofthe day. Usual introductions. 2 Questions. 1st question supposed to be a warmup, really simple bit manipulation, but for some reason my brain just went into a feeze, not sure if it was the stress or the sun from the lunch. Anyway I worked manually through some samples and did come up with an algorithm and a correct solution. In fact the interviewer corrected something in my solution, but when I started running it through a test case it turned out my initial code was in fact correct, so we reverted it. Because 1st question took so much time, we only had about 10 mins for the 2nd one which was supposed to be the main question. So we didn't really finish it. Recruiter called me a week later saying that they decided not to go forward with my candidacy at this time. I am not really too bothered since I am pretty happy at my current job and this was more of a learning experience, but I admit that if they did make me a good offer, I would've seriously considered it. While driving home I did come up with a really good solution to that unfinished question from the 5th session. And then also found every single question that I got asked in my interview on programming websites. So looks like if I wasn't so busy and just spent more time preparing, the interview would've gone much smoother. I thought just experience would be enough to pull me through. Other than the lunch person and the 2nd session interviewer, everybody else was very pleasant and enjoyable to talk to.

I was initially sent an email by a recruiter asking if I am interested in a role at Google. If so, I should provide contact details for him to call and discuss the type of role he had in mind. I showed interest and was duly contacted. I was explained what kind of a role they were looking to hire people for. I have always been in the academic field studying away for my degrees so the chance at my very first interview (esp. at Google) got me to say yes. Next I was allowed to choose a time that suited me for a technical interview (via phone and google docs) for which I was prepared in terms of knowledge but very unprepared in terms of the process of the interview.

He actually pointed out some small syntax mistakes in a way similar to a compiler "I don't see the variable Max".

I had been an intern, so I just had to do one system design and one algorithms design interview. From everything I'd been told, I had the required experience. I was then rejected because I supposedly didn't have enough experience working with large codebases. This was despite the fact that I was told during my internship that I had done a good job of that aspect. I was never told I needed that experience before hand (infact, I was told the opposite!), so it was rather frustrating. It was also silly that they interviewed me at all, given that my CV already eliminated me. It also took a long time to get the rejection, and it was in the form of a lengthy phone call from a manager explaining all about how I need more experience working with large codebases. It was very odd. I was told I could reapply in a year or 2.

I was contacted by a recruiter through my linkedin profile. The recruiter had a particular team in mind for me. It turned out I knew some people who already worked there, who highly recommended me, so I was able to bypass a phone screen. I was told I would have to do all of my interviews in either C, C++, or Java. I didn't know any of these languages particularly well (my professional experience has been more in dynamic scripting languages), so I told the recruiter I would need some time to review Java. I managed to drag it out for a number of weeks, but ultimately did not come in adequately prepared for Java coding exercises. The interview consisted of four or five back to back one hour one-on-one sessions with engineers asking challenging algorithm questions. One session seemed more focused on system design. One thing that was very challenging about this interview was its sustained level of intensity over a long period of time. By the time I hit hour 3 or so, I was mentally drained. The other was that I was trying to use a language I didn't know well. In addition, the algorithm questions are obviously just designed to be challenging, and your time is very limited. I did come away feeling like Google would be a great place to be an engineer. The interviewers seemed to want me to succeed for the most part.

Phone interview, on-site interview. Both involved specific programming problems and they asked me to write some unit tests. For the on-site interview, I had 5 sessions of 45-minute programming problems with a lunch meeting with an employee in between. Overall very impersonal, I felt like they were only interested in how I coded, not as much about why I was interested in the role or what my previous experience was. I was also disappointment that I went to lunch with an older hardware engineer when I was applying as a younger software engineer. It was hard to get a sense of who my co-workers would be or what my day-to-day life would be like.

First there was a technical phone interview, with a fairly straightforward programming problem using Google Docs to write on. Then I heard back to schedule the onsite portion. Flights and hotel are paid for, and they're rather flexible to work with your schedule. The onsite interview was 4 technical questions with lunch after the first two. All the questions are fairly difficult, they skip right past the easy ones and only talk briefly about your resume and experience. Definitely know big O notation and be able to calculate the time complexity for any code you write. A lot of problems involved graphs or matrices, but involved other data structures as well. They give you a full list of what you should know beforehand, and much of it will be covered.

A Googler from Mountain View contacted me and we went over 3 different questions. The first question I knew how to do since I completed it a week before the interview and I told the interviewer. I briefly ran through my logic and we went forward to the next question (without writing any codes). The second question consisted of tree traversal (simple question) and the third question consisted of a little bit more input and thought. I was not able to directly answer it and asked numerous questions to get a better scope of the problem. In the end, I was able to write the program on Google Docs. A week later I was contacted for an onsite interview, which I have in a few days. I put "No" for did you get an offer because I have yet to do the on-site interview.

I first had two technical interviews by phone that went quite well. Then I did an onsite (I live 10 miles away from their campus) that consisted of 6 sessions of interviews. Despite the claim that Google no longer uses puzzles in interviews, I found that 2 out of 6 interviews consisted of solving tedious puzzles. I would say that 4 of the 6 sets of interviewers were friendly, one fellow was outright cold, one was slightly negative. Interviewer 1 (solo): Friendly and enthusiastic. Interviewer 2 (solo): Friendly but not enthusiastic. Seemed to want to hire a different type of person more like himself. Interviewer 3 (solo): Rather cold. He did tell me he knew that I'd interviewed at Youtube earlier, which felt creepy especially because the more memorable interviewers at Youtube were creepy. Imagine being reminded of a BAD experience. Right after which, he presented a tedious puzzle! When I was solving his puzzle, I felt I was constantly interrupted and hounded. I wanted to ask him to please be quiet, but I judged from his attitude that could have ended the interview prematurely. In the Q&A part, it was revealed he had never heard of Google's Project Ara. Maybe he was having a bad day... at my expense. Interviewer 4 (lunchtime casual talk, solo): Friendly and enthusiastic. It was a relief to talk with him after the previous guy. A big relief... Interviewer 5 (solo): Moderately friendly, presented a puzzle. I solved it. I got a feeling he seemed to want to hire a different type of person more like himself. Interviewer 6 (solo): Someone quite like myself. Only person to ask intelligent/wise questions and took notes. To Google's credit, there were no team interviews (that I recall). Long after the interview, I got emails from Google asking me to help them improve their interview process. That's why I came to Glassdoor....

Finally I finish up the efficient solution, he asked me to refactor the codes and I did. The second one, an Indian, three technical questions. The phone is not quite clear. So he wrote the questions down on the Google docs. I finished them all.

Applied through a employee referral. Was contacted by a recruiter who asked me about my background and told me about the interview process (1-2 phone screens and then ~5 on-site interviews). He then scheduled a phone screen with one of their engineers. The phone screen was a bit odd I think, the person did not really introduce her self and jumped right to the questions. The rush made me a little bit more nervous but I guess she didn't think the usual background/interests chat mattered. Otherwise the format was very similar to other technical phone screens I've done. It took a rather long time for the recruiter to get back to me and actually it wasn't until I sent him an email >3 weeks later that he promptly replied that he coincidentally just received the results (right) and there weren't enough positives to move forward.

Started off with some knowledge questions about graphs (no coding). Then a rather tricky combinatorics problem that involved a base 9 number system (as opposed to binary base 2 or hex base 16).

The process was initiated by a recruiter, who reached out to me via email. He told me that he found me through my LinkedIn profile, and was interested in having a short phone conversation. During that conversation, we chatted about my skills and experience, and he outlined a potential role (SET) to gauge my interest. Once I told him that I was interested, he set me up with a engineering phone screen, which was one hour long. The phone screen consisted of me talking with another SET. He briefly outlined his experience, and then asked me to talk a bit about myself. This lasted 5-10 minutes, and then we moved on to a programming question. All of the code I wrote was in a Google doc. About 2 weeks after the phone screen, I was contacted by my recruiter to let me know that they wanted to bring me on-site. They flew me out on a Sunday, and the full day of interviews were on Monday. I then flew back on Tuesday. The onsite interviews are where they really get a feel for how well you understand data structures and algorithms, and how you think under pressure. The day consisted of 5 45-minute interviews, and a 45 minute lunch. Each interview was basically the same format as the phone screen: 5-10 minutes of getting to know one another, followed by coding questions. It's important to note that the coding questions are all done on a whiteboard, so it is really important to practice coding questions by hand. You really don't appreciate how nice autocomplete is until you're working without it. After the onsite interviews, each of the interviewers will write feedback about you, and give you a score. This feedback is all given to a hiring committee, who (unofficially) makes the decision of whether or not to hire you. There is still the executive and compensation committees after that, but from what I have read and heard from my recruiter, the hiring committee is the tough one to pass. Overall, I think this process was pretty smooth. I dragged it out a bit, because I hadn't used Java in years, and I had a big project going on at my current job, but expect the process to take at least 2-3 months from first contact to offer.

I had one phone round and an onsite with 5 rounds.The HR communicated very efficiently while setting up the interviews and gave quick responses to any query. The phone interview was quite easy. The onsite interview was a really good experience. The questions were not very difficult, but it truly tests one's concepts and the ability to think. It is coding intensive and focuses on data structures and algorithm. One has to be very through with the basics and know to evaluate time and space complexity. I cannot mention the questions due to the NDA. The best thing about the interview was that all the interviewers were very pleasant to talk with and make one feel comfortable. They bring out the best in you and help you out in thinking with hints and questions. I attended few other interviews after Google and found quite a difference. It is my best interview experience till date with respect to people interaction.
