No. 01 - Binary Search Tree and Double-linked List
Convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list. We can only change the target of pointers, but cannot create any new nodes.

No. 06 - Post-order Traversal Sequences of Binary Search Trees
Determine whether an input array is a post-order traversal sequence of a binary tree or not. If it is, return true; otherwise return false. Assume all numbers in an input array are unique.

No. 07 - Reverse words in a sentence
Reverse the order of words in a sentence, but keep words themselves unchanged. Words in a sentence are divided by blanks. For instance, the reversed output should be “student. a am I” when the input is “I am a student”.

No. 10 - K-th Node from End
Get the Kth node from end of a linked list. It counts from 1 here, so the 1st node from end is the tail of list.

No. 11 - Print Binary Trees from Top to Bottom
Please print a binary tree from its top level to bottom level, and print nodes from left to right if they are in same level.

No. 12 - Mirror of Binary Trees
Please implement a function which returns mirror of a binary tree.

No. 16 - Maximal Length of Incremental Subsequences
Given an unsorted array, find the max length of subsequence in which the numbers are in incremental order.

No. 18 - Reverse a Linked List
Implement a function to reverse a linked list, and return the head of the reversed list.

No. 20 - Number of 1 in a Binary
Please implement a function to get the number of 1s in an integer. For example, the integer 9 is 1001 in binary, so it returns 2 since there are two bits of 1s.

No. 35 - Depth of Binary Trees
How do you get the depth of a binary tree? Nodes from the root to a leaf form a path. Depth of a binary tree is the maximum length of all paths.

No. 49 - Longest Substring without Duplication
Given a string, please get the length of the longest substring which does not have duplicated characters. Supposing all characters in the string are in the range from ‘a’ to ‘z’.
