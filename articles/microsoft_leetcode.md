No. 01 - Binary Search Tree and Double-linked List
Convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list. We can only change the target of pointers, but cannot create any new nodes.

No. 06 - Post-order Traversal Sequences of Binary Search Trees
Determine whether an input array is a post-order traversal sequence of a binary tree or not. If it is, return true; otherwise return false. Assume all numbers in an input array are unique.

No. 10 - K-th Node from End
Get the Kth node from end of a linked list. It counts from 1 here, so the 1st node from end is the tail of list.

No. 16 - Maximal Length of Incremental Subsequences
Given an unsorted array, find the max length of subsequence in which the numbers are in incremental order.

No. 49 - Longest Substring without Duplication
Given a string, please get the length of the longest substring which does not have duplicated characters. Supposing all characters in the string are in the range from ‘a’ to ‘z’.

Microsoft Interview Questions: Software Development Engineer (SDE)
  You’re given an array containing both positive and negative integers and required to find the sub-array with the largest sum (O(N) a la KBL). Write a routine in C for the above.
  Given an array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N, determine if there are any duplicates in it. You are allowed to destroy the array if you like. [ I ended up giving about 4 or 5 different solutions for this, each supposedly better than the others ].
  Write a routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making use of any floating point computations at all.
  Given only putchar (no sprintf, itoa, etc.) write a routine putlong that prints out an unsigned long in decimal.
  Give a one-line C expression to test whether a number is a power of 2. No loops allowed.
  What are the different ways to implement a condition where the value of x can be either a 0 or a 1?
  Insert in a sorted list.

Microsoft Interview Questions: Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)
  Write a function that inserts an integer into a linked list in ascending order. Write the test cases for this function.
  Test the save dialog in Notepad.
  Write the InStr function. Write the test cases for this function.
  Write a function that will return the number of days in a month (no using System.DateTime).
  Write the test cases for a vending machine.

Microsoft’s most asked interview questions
  2) Remove duplicates from a string, do it in-place
  5) Print last 10 lines of a big file or big string.
  7) Connect nodes at same level.
  9) Test case questions like test an ATM.
  10) Run length encoding.
  12) Given a sorted array of size n. Each element in array is unique and lies from 1 to n+1. Find the missing element. Write code and test cases for the same.
  14) Validate a given IP address
  16) Two of the nodes of a BST are swapped. Correct the BST
  17) Draw a circle without floating point arithmetic

Given an arbitrary polygon and a point within it, write an algorithm to find an inner triangle enclosing the point where one of the arbitrary vertices has the smallest angle possible making up two edges of the inner polygon (yes, that confusing).

Given a matrix of substrings, find the longest word in an arbitrary dictionary array when starting from an arbitrary point in the matrix with the ability to only move right or down from the starting point.

You have a string input with text, where space between words was removed and method bool IsWord(string word) returning true if the string given is a word. Return the sentence with restored space between words.

You have a method bool Perform(string inputA, string inputB, string Validation) returning true if Validation string contains both inputA and inputB (can be interleaved)... for example for Perform("ABC","XYZ","AXYBCZ") return true;

You have Ackermann function. I am actually not sure what the question was supposed to be, but the interviewer asked about how high m,n you can input not to end with stack overflow error.

You were part of the Microsoft Azure team. We got a call at 2am in the morning from a customer telling us that the service is down. What could possibly happen?

Print all the permutations of the string

Find the next larger element in a BST.

Implement hashing, how to maintain count of hits on website for last 2 minutes.

#Reverse Integer
  - If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
  - Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
  - Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option? You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an extra parameter).
